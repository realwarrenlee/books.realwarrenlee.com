### Before Enlistment

After years of dread that turned into ambivalence, enlistment day finally arrived. It marks the start of my National Service journey. Accompanied by my family, I left from the BMT centre @ Pasir Ris, boarded a shuttle to the SAF Ferry Terminal (SFT), and sailed across to Pulau Tekong, which would be my home for the coming weeks.

On arrival at the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC), I completed my paperwork and received my company assignment: BMTC School III, Raven Company. This company known for its inclusion of female recruits. After a brief orientation, we stood together for the solemn oath-taking ceremony, then shared a simple farewell lunch with my family.

### Confinement

The afternoon was dedicated to sizing and receiving our equipment, as well as getting acquainted with our bunkmates and commanding officers. I was assigned to Section 2, led by a nonchalant French sergeant, while our Platoon 2 sergeant is an alumni from River Valley High School. He was tall and muscular. At full strength, our platoon numbered 55 recruits, with 15 in my section.

My bunkmates are predominantly Chinese with three Indian comrades, mostly from junior colleges (NYJC, VJC, TJC, DHS, SAJC, and CJC), polytechnics, and international schools. Among us was one recoursee who had previously dropped out of Dragon Company in week 4 due to pneumonia. We also had two regulars from the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), one of whom already holds the rank of 3rd Sergeant. The living conditions exceeded my expectations. The toilets were clean and newly renovated, and the beds relatively comfortable. I was assigned to bed number 05, a lower bunk position.

A significant milestone came when I had my head shaved completely "botak" for the first time. The transformation felt and looked strange initially, but in an environment where everyone had the identical hairstyle, I realized I blended right in.

As evening approached, I enjoyed a surprisingly tasty dinner, followed by an administrative session completing necessary forms. The day concluded with a light night snack. Our final activity allowed us to call our families and enjoy some admin time. After a brief conversation with my parents, I took a refreshing shower and played with my phone before lights out at 2330, marking the end of my first day as a National Service recruit—the lowest rank in SAF.

<u>Strength Training</u>

My second day began with the official reveille at 0630, though I was already awake by 0618 from the sounds of my section mates moving about the bunk. We proceeded downstairs and marched in formation to the cookhouse for breakfast.

Unfortunately, the quality of the food was poor. I lost my appetite at the sight of the soggy porridge and settled for just a croissant and two cups of Milo to start my day. After breakfast, we returned to the company area for morning physical training.

Though scheduled for two hours, approximately 90 minutes were consumed by detailed instructions rather than actual exercise. This was followed by several informational lectures focused on transitioning from civilian to military life, safety protocols, and other fundamental knowledge essential for new recruits. The content, while necessary, was tediously delivered.

Lunch consisted of packed food, which I found more palatable than the cookhouse offerings. Dinner followed the same pattern of improvement. For these meals, I took only the meat portions and less than half the rice, disposing of the excess. The late afternoon schedule included a fire drill, followed by additional lectures and administrative activities before we were finally granted our personal free time in the evening. Like the previous day, my day concluded with lights out at 2330.

<u>Ellis Machine</u>

By my third day, I was already adapting to the military schedule. I woke up slightly before 0600 and found myself unable to return to sleep. I got up at 0620 and fell in with my section at 0640. The morning routine is becoming familiar now. Wake up, brush my teeth, wash my face, change into the proper attire, pack my backpack, and march to the cookhouse for breakfast.

Following our morning meal, we participated in strength training exercises. Though noticeably more challenging than the previous day's session, the workout remained at a basic level. The fitness instructor made it clear that both the intensity and frequency of physical training will progressively increase throughout BMT. After the session concluded, we had a half-hour break before our next scheduled activity, which was an engagement with our commanding officer.

I took advantage of this brief window to enjoy a quick shower, which felt remarkably refreshing after the morning's physical exertion. These small moments of personal comfort are becoming increasingly valuable as I adjust to the structured military lifestyle.

Next came team bonding exercises where we established section values and goals, and assigned various in-charge (IC) roles. Following this, all four sections gathered to repeat the process at the platoon level. Afterward, we visited the National Service (NS) gallery. It was a brief tour showcasing the history of NS and highlighting reasons to serve, featuring quotes from Lee Kuan Yew. For me, the visit was more an opportunity to enjoy air conditioning than to learn about NS. When we finished, heavy rain was falling outside.

The scheduled orientation run was delayed due to the weather, so we proceeded to a building beside the track to test the sit-up and push-up machines used for the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT). The sit-up machine worked well. My elbows only needed to touch my knees for repetitions to count. However, the push-up machine seemed problematic, failing to count about half of my repetitions. This was concerning.

After dinner, we attended a lecture on SAF core values and Army ranks, followed by Last Parade. Then came admin time, which is growing shorter as our wake-up time gets earlier. Lights out is always 7 hours before reveille.

<u>Foot Drills</u>

My fourth day brought my first running session in over three weeks. We began with a short jog around the parade square—not on a proper track but on concrete bricks instead. After one round, we stopped for dynamic stretches to warm up our bodies properly. This preparation led into the structured 10-minute paced run at 7.30 min/km, followed by 5 minutes at our own pace.

We also began foot drills training, where I truly embodied the blur recruit stereotype. With commands issued in Malay, I struggled to comprehend and found myself desperately watching others to mimic their movements. Despite my efforts, I frequently lost my place and joined several others singled out for "personal tuition" from the sergeants.

As I navigate these challenges, I have developed a newfound appreciation for my former student life. Academic pursuits now seem remarkably easier and more meaningful compared to military service. While I am adapting adequately to physical training, regimentation presents a significant struggle. The constant restrictions weigh heavily on me, from structured water consumption to precise foot drills to maintaining a meticulously organized Stand By Area (SBA).

The regulated water parades exemplify this regimentation. I have begun forcing myself to feel thirsty just to consume half a bottle during these scheduled hydration periods. Ironically, this system has reduced my overall water intake, evidenced by increasingly concentrated urine. Focus on the wrong metrics, achieve counterproductive results.

Admin time continues to shrink with each passing day. After a brief call to my parents, lights-out was immediately announced, leaving me without even the opportunity to brush my teeth. Without sufficient time to document my daily experiences, I resorted to using my mandated seven hours of uninterrupted rest to record my thoughts. This carries considerable risk—several bunkmates have already been caught using phones after hours. I narrowly escaped detection by quickly concealing my phone during an unexpected inspection.

<u>Metabolic Circuit</u>

By the fifth day, I had fully adjusted to the military routine. Reveille at 0530, physical training in the morning and evening, lectures surrounding lunch, last parade before admin time, and lights out at 2230.

The morning featured a metabolic circuit training where we rotated through eight different exercise stations, using jumping jacks as transitions between each station. We completed two full rounds of this circuit.

Evening brought another running session. This time, we faced a 10-minute paced run followed by an additional 10 minutes of free-pace running. Toward the end, after the whistle signaled the conclusion, I succumbed to the heat and retreated to the shade rather than completing the final round.

After dinner came more foot drills practice. I am gradually becoming accustomed to the commands and have started identifying strategic positions in the formation—particularly in the second row or near either the front or back of the formation. The interior positions provide more room for minor errors. Nevertheless, maintaining complete focus remains essential to avoid mistakes, and synchronizing movements with my platoon mates continues to present challenges.

<u>Orientation Run</u>

As I entered the sixth day, I still have not pooped, which is becoming increasingly concerning. To address this, I have changed my diet by adding more variety. Breakfast now includes extra bread with different spreads. Peanut butter, kaya, and strawberry jam. For lunch and dinner, I finished my rice portions, and I started eating fruits like apples and oranges.

This morning brought disappointment when rain forced our scheduled distance interval training to be replaced with strength exercises. Given the choice, I would always prefer running over strength training despite it being more exhausting for the repetitiveness of strength work had become tedious after so many sessions.

The evening proved more interesting when our planned sports and games session transformed into an orientation run. Despite sounding less appealing initially, it was actually enjoyable. Our platoon commander guided us around the BMTC, showing us important landmarks including field camp locations, the soldier statue, and the main building where high-ranking officers are stationed.

A camera sergeant followed along, taking photos of our group throughout the run. Admin time was more generous today, likely to accommodate self-directed learning (SDL) on our newly issued laptops. SDL is completely pointless. Everyone simply searches for answers online in the NS vault rather than learning the material. I finished modules in under a minute and completed the entire package in less than four hours. Even the sergeants know we are all cutting corners because they did the same during their training.

I feel my foot drill performance is improving as I need less conscious focus to march in sync with others. I have found the key is taking smaller strides with a higher cadence while allowing movements to feel natural. Once I stopped forcing coordination between my arms and legs, everything began flowing better.

<u>CPR + AED</u>

The seventh day brought a welcome change of pace. With IPPT scheduled for the following day, today was deliberately lighter on physical training. Our morning was dedicated to CPR and AED training, which included theoretical instruction, hands-on practice, and a skills assessment measuring the frequency and depth of our chest compressions.

Lunch was exceptional today in celebration of Hari Raya. The meal featured special treats including ice cream, rose muffins, and longan soup. I managed to quietly take two muffins back, even after taking two muffins for lunch.

Next was the Combat Buddy Aid session where we learned critical skills like controlling bleeding, using First Aid Dressing (FAD), and carrying injured personnel. It was then when I finally experienced relief from my digestive concerns and had a bowel movement. I also completed packing my "10 pack" equipment required for the upcoming field camp.

My night routine has shifted too. Instead of rushing to the toilet to bathe, I now enjoy the night snack and bring some back to the bunk.

### IPPT

Waking up at 0430 on the eighth day marked the earliest I have ever risen. Interestingly, I have been waking naturally just over 10 minutes before reveille these past few days, without needing my alarm.

Despite the early start, our IPPT test did not begin until 0630, following briefings, waiting periods, and warm-up exercises. By the time I tackled sit-ups, I managed 47 repetitions before core cramping forced me to stop. For push-ups, I prioritized proper form and a deliberate pace over speed because I feared the machine would not count if I did my push ups too fast. The accumulated fatigue from numerous training sessions left my arms sore, limiting me to just 32 push-ups.

The 2.4 km run commenced at 0730 under bright blue, cloudless skies. Fortunately, despite the clear weather, the sun was not yet intense, providing excellent running conditions. I positioned myself at the rear of the group initially, gradually working my way toward the middle of the pack, and completed the run in 11 minutes and 19 seconds. My final IPPT score was 74 points—just one point shy of silver, which was decent, I guess.

<u>Combat Circuit</u>

For the ninth day, our physical endurance was truly tested when we carried our heavy field packs from coyline to Ellis—the same location where we took the IPPT. The weight was oppressive, making this feel like our longest march yet.

Upon reaching the field, we began our Combat Circuit training. This challenging sequence involved running laps around the field interspersed with static exercises, followed by various crawling maneuvers and sprinting drills. We practiced different crawling techniques including bear crawl, leopard crawl, and baby crawl. The difficulty intensified when we had to perform squats and lunges while holding on to our field packs.

By the end, my uniform was completely soaked—not from sweat but from the rainwater that had collected on the field in the previous days. After completing the circuit, we hurried to a scheduled lecture but arrived 8 minutes late, resulting in a serious reprimand. While our platoon has been late on previous occasions, this instance was particularly grave since the presentation was being delivered by a high-ranking officer. Our section sergeant warned that this infraction could potentially result in his confinement, and the matter was escalated to the platoon commander.

The evening brought Basic Close Combat Training (BCCT). Though I personally found the practical applications useless, I found it to be an entertaining break from our physical training.

<u>Duty Platoon</u>

On the tenth day, our platoon was on duty. We had to move dumbbells from one location to another in preparation for the day's strength training session. Morning rain forced our strength training indoors, making the dumbbells we had moved unnecessary.

Following our modified physical training, we were granted admin time until the rain subsided. Once the weather cleared, we had to relocate the dumbbells yet again to another area.

The afternoon followed our now-familiar schedule with recruitment and resilience talks. These sessions have become a predictable part of our training regimen. The evening brought another BCCT session, continuing our introduction to hand-to-hand combat techniques that began yesterday.

After last parade, our responsibilities as duty platoon continued as we had to shift the dumbbells once more before finally receiving our admin time.

<u>Endurance Run</u>

Entering my second weekend and eleventh day in Palau Tekong, my mood was improving with book out approaching and the generous admintime over the past few days. The morning's endurance run was particularly challenging due to the heat. Even at my relatively slow pace of about 7:30 min/km, my body overheated, leaving me feeling nauseous. I pushed through subsequent activities—testing shields and batons, practicing search techniques, and handcuffing procedures for arrests—but found them boring. The heat was strong, affecting me even in shaded areas.

The afternoon brought frustration when our sergeants deemed our marching substandard. We were forced to repeat marching drills until our arms maintained proper "90-45" positions and our voices reached sufficient volume. Later, when sergeants asked who had been sleeping or inattentive, I honestly admitted my lapse, but surprisingly received no punishment.

Back in the bunk, a recruit from Section 3 confronted me. He mentioned he had been observing my marching, claiming I was not maintaining proper arm positions (which I disagree with) and that I was not loud enough (which was fair criticism). Despite investing considerable effort into marching, I struggle with maintaining synchronization with the platoon for extended periods. He ended with a warning to "watch out," though he did apologize days later. In contrast, an international student from my section was encouraging, claiming I gave "200%" effort, even marching while feverish.

Eventually, my section mates insisted I report to the medical office after taking my temperature, which exceeded 38°C. I was given light duty for two days. The day concluded with another rehearsal for weapon presentation, followed by a feedback session with our platoon commanders, platoon sergeants, and section sergeants. The evening felt rushed as I was dismissed at 2030 hours with lights out at 2100.

<u>Weapon Presentation</u>

The twentieth day was an important milestone in my BMT journey, as it featured the weapon presentation ceremony. I woke up at the earliest hour of 0400, stirred by the lights coming on in the room. We gathered our weapons and ate our ration meals before boarding the ferry to Changi Beach. There was a palpable sense of relief among everyone as we breathed the mainland air, a welcome change after being confined to Pulau Tekong for more than two weeks.

The weapon presentation ceremony went smoothly—I simply followed the procedure and everything proceeded without issue. My parents did not attend, however. They had thought the ceremony was brief and hence was not worth the long journey from our home to Changi Beach. There was about an hour allocated afterward for interaction with parents and loved ones, which I missed out on.

After returning to Pulau Tekong by ferry, we had barely ten minutes in our bunks before lunch was served. The afternoon provided three hours of administrative time, followed by indoor physical training due to rain. I could not participate because I was on light duty, so instead I took out my notebook and recorded my observations and thoughts.

Time passed quickly. The training session was scheduled for two hours but finished in just one. We had dinner before 0600, followed by the last parade before 0700—the earliest so far. Afterward, I rested briefly before beginning my self-regulated training (SRT). I had a short ten minute workout consisting of a 2 km run and some push ups. The queue to sign in and out for the exercise area was extremely long, likely because it was the first time SRT was available to us.

<u>ISAD</u>

Day thirteen began with our standard strength training session. In the afternoon, we traveled from Ladang to Rocky Hill Camp for the Infantry Small Arms Demonstration (ISAD) to witness live firings of the SAR 21 rifle. At the 100-meter range, we observed demonstrations on watermelons, tree logs, and sandbags. Though this was a new experience for me, it felt strangely familiar after having seen such demonstrations in videos numerous times.

Following the demonstration, we underwent a rigorous detailed check for ammunition. We even had to take an oath declaring we were not carrying any live rounds. The procedure required us to strip down to just our uniforms for a full body search followed by a metal detector scan. I found it amusing that the French sergeant was reluctant to touch sweaty recruits and instead asked the Malay sergeants to conduct the checks.

Next came BCCT, focusing on lower body techniques for kicks. By evening, we faced our field pack initial inspection, which proved to be an ordeal. The sergeants continuously shouted about missed timings while decreasing the allowed time with each iteration. Meanwhile, my platoon mates were yelling to standardize the format, creating a chaotic atmosphere. Despite the confusion, we eventually managed to meet the requirements and were left with a reasonable amount of admin time afterward.

<u>Vaccination</u>

Day fourteen began with Combat Circuit 2 proving challenging, especially when I needed to use the restroom midway through. It was my worst toilet experience yet—I had held it in too long, and the facilities were filthy.

Vaccinations followed, but I was exempted due to my sore throat and cough. This meant two hours in an air-conditioned room where I could use my phone—a rare luxury. I finally managed to use a cleaner restroom there, though it was not without issues. My stool was liquid and scattered all around the bowl due to gas. After lunch, I used the toilet again and noticed blood, which was concerning.

We had some rest time afterward before heading to swimming training, which turned out to be a frustrating experience. Upon arriving, we faced dark skies and a light drizzle, but the activity was initially cleared to begin. However, as soon as I got down to the pool, a lightning alert forced us to halt. We waited several minutes while the Officer Commanding delivered safety briefings. When we attempted to return to the pool—I was already in the queue—another lightning alert sounded. After another lengthy wait, we ultimately abandoned swimming and returned to our bunks for a briefing on tomorrow's weapon handling, which would include assembly and disassembly practice.

Dinner and night snacks were exceptional highlights of the day. I enjoyed two ice creams during dinner. Since we had marched well and met our sergeants' expectations, we were granted admin time afterward. Last parade ended before 0700, with night snacks served immediately after.

After last parade, Sections 2 and 3 were instructed to stay behind by the platoon sergeant. My section had left the keys on the table and was punished with buddha claps, forced to repeat "I will defend the keys with my life" with each clap. Section 3 had left the lights on, so their punishment involved chanting "I will not waste electricity."

The night snack consisted of brownies which were extremely popular. Supplies quickly ran out, but my section managed to smuggle over twenty of them. What had started as my individual effort had evolved into a section-wide operation, with other sections in our platoon adopting similar tactics.

<u>Swim</u>

Day fifteen began with a morning run. The French sergeant marched us to our supposed running location, only to find no one there. He let out a "fuck mom" before marching us back to the coyline. On our return, we encountered our platoon sergeant, who promptly had us turn around and march back to the original destination. It was a complete waste of time and energy.

Next came Tactical Handling Training (THT), which involved assembling and disassembling our weapons along with Immediate Action (IA) drills. I managed the assembly and disassembly with minimal difficulty, but the IA drills were another story—I experienced failure after failure until, with considerable help from my section mates, I finally passed.

Swimming followed, covering a 50-meter distance using breaststroke. We were categorized based on swimming ability, from C (unable to swim) to A (able to swim the full length of the pool). I earned a category A rating, though I needed to breathe more frequently than ideal.

The meals that day were a pleasant surprise as bananas appeared for both lunch and dinner. After having apples for so long, the bananas were a welcome change—I took four during lunch and another two at dinner. Following our evening meal, we returned to THT. Once again, I struggled and had to make multiple attempts. There was little admin time afterward.

After last parade, two recruits faced disciplinary action. One was from my section, reprimanded by the platoon commander for being in a toilet cubicle after lights out the previous night. According to my section mates who witnessed the incident, three sergeants had stationed themselves outside his cubicle, and there had been no sound of running water. We joked that he might have been wanking. The next day, his usually talkative nature gave way to silence, though this subsided by afternoon.

The other incident involved someone from Section 3 who was disciplined for being disrespectful to the sergeants. I witnessed him slam a table during a conversation with the Section 1 sergeant while I was eating my night snack. This prompted our platoon sergeant to erupt in anger, calling the entire platoon down for a stern lecture about respect. It was an unpleasant experience, made worse by the timing—it was already past 2230, with lights out at 2230. After bathing, brushing my teeth, and calling my parents, I had very little time left before bed.

<u>Book Out</u>

Day sixteen was a special occasion I had been eagerly anticipating since enlistment—it was book out day. The morning began with our endurance run conducted in the rain. This was followed by a lecture on weapon cleaning and book in/book out procedures delivered by the Sergeant Major. I enjoyed bak kut teh for lunch, a welcome treat.

Next came our Stand By Bed (SBB) inspection, where we were thoroughly disciplined by the sergeants, primarily because our areas were dirty. They ran their hands across the tops of cabinets, doors, and windows, collecting dust which they then placed in the hands of our section IC as evidence of our negligence.

Moreover, I personally received a reprimand from the platoon commander for having long fingernails. Rather than shouting, he delivered it as a lecture on basic hygiene standards. After our chastisement for the failed SBB, we hurried downstairs and gathered at the basketball court for a briefing about GE2025. This information session did not apply to me since I am under 21 years old.

The ferry ride out of Tekong felt absolutely liberating. It was wonderful to return to mainland Singapore—the experience made me genuinely appreciate everyday conveniences more. Pulau Tekong had truly been like a rural outpost, isolated in the middle of nowhere.

### Grenade

My first book in filled me with dread. My reluctance was clearly visible on my face as I made the journey back to Pulau Tekong. By the time I arrived, it was already late in the day, so our activities were minimal.

<u>SOC</u>

In the morning, we tackled the Standard Obstacle Course (SOC). It was an easy conduct consisting of five elements: stepping stones, rubble, tunnel, dodging panels, ditch, and corridor. We skipped the low rope and low wall components. The afternoon session was dedicated to BCCT, which was held indoors due to a lightning alert. It involved practicing movement while executing hand strikes and kicks, which became super chaotic.

Our platoon had a new Meal IC, which provided some unexpected humor. The Meal IC's responsibility was to check for available tables, which were typically designated by letters. During his first assignment, he announced "C for cock," prompting the sergeant to immediately order him to repeat the announcement properly. The following days brought similar incidents. When the Malay sergeant was supervising us, he announced "M for Malay." Among all these blunders, I found "K for kan ni na" and "F for footjob" when we were standing behind some female recruits to be the most hilarious moments.

<u>Route March</u>

The morning began with an endurance run, followed by multiple lectures that continued even after lunch. We also received haircuts, returning to the standard "botak" style. In the late afternoon, we completed our 4 km route march around Salabin. Despite threatening skies, it fortunately remained clear, allowing the exercise to proceed without complications.

During the water parade, I stood in the front row. We had to tilt our canteens 90 degrees to show we had consumed half the water. Since my canteen was not half empty, I did not fully tilt it. A sergeant noticed this and pressed my canteen downward, causing water to spill out. As a consequence, he assigned me the role of Water IC for the next water parade (I would do it for the next few days).

Someone from my section poured water over himself, claiming he thought his canteen was empty. It was obviously false due to the large amount of water that came out. I initially thought this would be a minor incident, but I severely underestimated its consequences. After dinner, the sergeants gathered us on our level and instructed us to form a straight line in SBB formation. They ordered us to empty our canteens and refill them completely. When some trainees failed to fill their canteens to the brim, the platoon sergeants made everyone repeat the process—empty and refill—within a four minute time limit. When we could not meet this deadline, they extended it to five minutes and made us try again. The situation became chaotic, and I was surprised that such a seemingly small incident resulted in such significant disciplinary action.

That night, we received a demonstration on proper hand grenade throwing techniques. We practiced the required verbal commands and four standard positions which included standing, kneeling, prone, and prone-kneel-prone sequence, though without actually throwing dummy grenades.

<u>Hand Grenade</u>

Shortly after reveille, we gathered at the coyline for breakfast or to draw weapons. I noticed other platoons already getting scolded. Platoon 1 was being yelled at, which seemed to be a regular occurrence based on my observations. It was not that Platoon 1 made more mistakes—I believe my platoon actually committed more errors—but the sergeants overseeing Platoon 1 simply loved yelling at recruits. Platoon 4, the female platoon, received the longest scolding session of about 30 minutes. While collecting weapons, I overheard that some of the female recruits had been bathing after lights out. In contrast, my platoon's sergeants were more lenient, often granting time extensions to form up and issuing warnings before resorting to scolding. When they reprimanded us, it was justified—we were not meeting standards. As soldiers, we were expected to maintain standards.

After breakfast and drawing our weapons, we proceeded to the grenade range located just outside the school compound. This was for a dummy grenade throwing rehearsal of the four positions we had learned previously. Upon arrival, we faced a lightning alert and had to wait for an hour until 0830 before the sergeants could demonstrate the proper techniques.

Following the demonstration, the first group entered the throwing bays for rehearsal. During my turn, I struggled with proper grenade handling. I held it incorrectly, had difficulty twisting and pulling the safety ring, and did not throw sufficient distance. Nevertheless, the officers and sergeants supervising the bay provided guidance, and I progressively improved with each position.

After completing the exercise, we waited another hour before returning to base. That evening, I participated in my second SRT. We began with a warm-up and strength training session led by my sergeant for those who had failed their IPPT. However, most of my training focused on completing a 3 km run and performing pushups.

The following day featured our live hand grenade throwing exercise. We traveled by bus to a location near the ISAD. While taking pee in the forest, I could hear live ammunition being fired in the distance. I was assigned to detail 26, bay 4. Each detail consisted of four people, and there were four bays total for the live hand grenade throw. We began with smoke grenade practice. The blue smoke grenades emitted smoke upon detonation, and we were required to retrieve them afterward.

Following this preliminary exercise, our group joined other details as we moved deeper into the forest to the live hand grenade range. My detail waited in the designated area, observing other groups perform their throws. From our vantage point, I could not see much beyond smoke clouds—which, although larger than those from the smoke grenades, had a smaller radius than I had anticipated. The most striking aspect was the thunderous sound of the explosions echoing through the forest.

When my turn came, I had to wait for bays 1, 2, and 3 to complete their throws before I could proceed. During this waiting period, the Platoon 3 platoon sergeant engaged me in conversation, asking typical questions about my best and worst commanders and bunkmates. This distracted me, causing me to miss observing the throws from bays 1 and 2, though I caught a glimpse of the bay 3 throw.

My own performance was mediocre, primarily because I struggled again with removing the safety ring. Once I finally extracted it, my only concern was getting the grenade away from me as quickly as possible, which led to a rushed throw. In my haste, I forgot to secure my rifle with my left hand, resulting in it striking my chin—fortunately without causing injury. This marked my first and only experience throwing a live hand grenade.

After completing my throw, it was already past 1300, and we headed back for lunch. During lunch, I observed that the subsequent details were not proceeding with their training. Soon I learned that someone from my platoon had thrown what is known as a "blind grenade"—a grenade that failed to detonate. This required the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team to intervene and safely remove it. When the grenade eventually detonated under controlled conditions, the explosion was so powerful that I could hear it clearly despite being hundreds of meters away.

Another incident occurred just before this with the detail that followed mine. A fellow recruit from my section returned with a chipped upper right tooth. He explained that while talking to the same platoon sergeant who had been conversing with me, he became distracted. When he ducked in response to a grenade being thrown from another bay, his rifle struck his chin, chipping his tooth. Unfortunately, he could not locate the broken tooth fragment, as the bay was covered with small rocks of similar size and color. Fortunately, he was able to get dental treatment the following day.

The actual hand grenade throwing experience—for both smoke and live grenades—totaled less than 10 minutes. The majority of the day was spent waiting and conversing with fellow recruits. Attempting to sleep on the hard benches proved challenging. Most of my platoon mates tried to rest by covering their rifle muzzles with their hands and putting their heads on it, but this was extremely uncomfortable.

After completing the grenade exercise, we were required to take an oath, similar to the one at ISAD, declaring that we do not have any explosives. We then moved to the designated area to await transportation back to BMTC School 3. By this time, it was slightly past 1600. It was significantly earlier than the scheduled end time of 1800, which would normally have been followed by dinner.

We utilized the extra hours before the evening meal to clean our rifles. Meanwhile, those who had missed the 4 km route march or lacked proper heat acclimatization status were required to complete their route march during this time.

Shortly after dinner, we assembled at the futsal court that faced Singapore. The sunset created a spectacular backdrop—an orange glow beautifully merging with the deep blue sky. During the last parade, I noticed dozens of recruits being called forward and initially thought this signaled some disciplinary action. However, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. BMTC School 3 maintains a tradition of distributing donuts to the entire company to celebrate birthdays of recruits born in April. Each recruit received two donuts. Such welfare is simply incredible.

The next day was book out day and it was one of the most slack days I had experienced. We woke up for breakfast, followed by several hours of free time. Later, we attended a recruitment talk before lunch. The afternoon brought more free time until the SBB inspection, where we faced consequences because our lockers were not standardized. Fortunately, the exteriors were clean enough with minimal dust, so we avoided punishment for that aspect.

The most shocking moment came when a platoon sergeant pulled out a locker belonging to someone from section 3 to inspect the back—which was, predictably, dusty. I later discovered the sergeant had specifically targeted this inspection because he had noticed the recruit looking at his own locker with visible satisfaction.

### IPPT

My return to camp was disastrous. I arrived 20 minutes late, making me the last one to report in. The platoon sergeant even threatened that I would need to make my own way to SAF Ferry Terminal (SFT). Fortunately, after reaching Pasir Ris MRT station, I managed to squeeze through crowds of civilians and recruits from Wolf Company despite the rain and narrow walkways. I eventually made my way to BMT @ Pasir Ris. Upon arrival, the sergeants were visibly shocked and remained silent. I had worn the incorrect uniform, Long 4 instead of Smart 4. Several of my section mates quickly came to help me correct my attire.

We arrived at Pulau Tekong at 1900 hours. As soon as we disembarked, I witnessed sergeants shouting at Platoon 1, forcing them to march an additional round around the school grounds. Meanwhile, our platoon commander summoned us to the training shack adjacent to the basketball court to address the issue of late reporting. Rather than shouting, he calmly questioned us and explained that the consequences for being late could be either delayed book out or confinement.

Once all platoons had settled in, we proceeded to last parade. Afterward, the sergeants addressed our platoon regarding our substandard conduct throughout the day. They later came to my bunk specifically to discuss the late reporting incident. I learned that my punishment would be guard duty assignment the following day. Honestly, I felt anxious due to the horror stories the platoon sergeant from Platoon 1 had shared before last parade. However, I was more concerned about sleep deprivation, as guard duty would severely interrupt my rest period. I would be fortunate to get even five hours of sleep.

<u>Guard Duty</u>

The next day began with BCCT in the morning. Afterward, we were directed to the lecture theater without any explanation of why we were going there. We sat waiting for an extended period with no instructions given, leaving us uncertain about the purpose of the gathering. I wondered if perhaps the lecturer was running late. Eventually, I discovered we were there for a mandatory urine drug test. The procedure required us to provide a urine sample in a small collection bottle, which was then tested using a compact device to verify we hadn't consumed any illegal substances. Only after everyone had completed their drug tests did the actual lecture commence.

Following lunch, we proceeded to the safety corner to collect our field ration packs for the upcoming week's field camp. This was followed by SDL time, which was my free time. However, it was abruptly interrupted by the sergeant supervising us for the day. He ordered us to assemble downstairs within three minutes. When we arrived, he instructed us to drop because we had failed to properly acknowledge his message.

This particular sergeant's behavior was seriously problematic. Paradoxically, he told me he "didn't like scolding people" while simultaneously smiling and reprimanding us—a clear contradiction.

It's unsurprising that when asked to identify the worst commander, my platoon mates consistently point to him. Many have noted that he lacks leadership aura, preferring to issue orders rather than creating an environment that inspires willing followership.

Next on the schedule was the fartlek run, but I was excused due to my guard duty assignment. At 1600, I formed up with others from my company who were also assigned guard duty. We then proceeded to the cookhouse for an early dinner, though we had to wait as the food was not ready. In the end, only the Muslim meals were available at that time.

After dinner, our group walked to Tekong Ferry Terminal (TFT) where we were divided into three guard duty details: TFT, Ammo Dump, and School 4. I was assigned to School 4. Along with those assigned to the Ammo Dump, we boarded a tonner (military transport truck) to our respective locations. I arrived at Rocky Hill School 4 at 1800, where we collected our bedsheets, and awaited further instructions. The accommodation was air-conditioned, and night snacks were provided.

Our group of nine was divided into two roles: sentry and prowler. Three were assigned as sentries while six served as prowlers (working in pairs). Sentries remained stationed at entry points, opening gates for vehicles, recording vehicle numbers and visit purposes. Prowlers patrolled the school, which was divided into three clusters. Our patrol route included seven checkpoints at various armskote locations, where we had to sign logbooks to verify our presence. Each shift lasted two hours, during which we had to complete two full patrol rounds. My partner and I typically finished one round in about 40 minutes, and we would rest in the air-conditioned room for approximately 15 minutes before beginning our second round.

I was scheduled for two shifts: 2300 to 0100 and 0500 to 0700. When I returned to rest at 0100, I struggled to sleep because the sergeants in the adjacent room were extremely noisy. I eventually fell asleep but was awakened at 0400 by the lights and sounds of other prowlers entering. Unable to return to sleep, I prepared slowly after being informed by the previous prowlers that we should begin at 0430. We actually departed at 0450 and completed our duties by 0630, followed by breakfast.

After breakfast, we took the tonner back to School 3, where we saw our company engaged in distance interval training. Meanwhile, we returned to our bunks to shower and rest. Later, we were instructed to go down and draw our weapons. There, I witnessed members of my platoon being punished. All were from my section. I learned they were being punished for failing to register for the polar class. Someone commented that those individuals formed a "5-man Mobile Legends team," which prompted laughter from another section mate who was subsequently punished as well. Fortunately for us, SDL was scheduled until lunch. Despite my exhaustion, I only managed about an hour of light sleep.

After lunch, we attended the Commanding Officer's engagement session. It began with a video presentation highlighting our BMT journey, from our first day arriving in civilian clothes to our current status. The Commanding Officer then addressed several issues affecting our training. First, he announced that recruits would now be permitted to use vending machines, though the Cheers convenience stores would remain off-limits. He also discussed incidents involving BCCT instructors. One instructor had apparently stood too close to female recruits. Another had made unprofessional comments, telling a female recruit, "Which vocation are you going? Air Force? All the girls there damn chio!" When he learned she was assigned to the Medical Corps instead, he simply switched to saying, "All the girls in medics damn chio!"

The Commanding Officer also informed us that our upcoming field camp would incorporate combat buddy aid training rather than solely focusing on firing positions and enemy engagement tactics.

Following the engagement session, we proceeded to our second SOC, focusing on the higher elements, including balancing bridge, window, apex ladder, and terrace. I found the balancing bridge to be the most challenging due to its narrow path. In contrast, the apex ladder, despite its height, was relatively simple. It was similar to climbing up and down stairs. To improve my proficiency, I practiced the balancing bridge several additional times to become more comfortable with it.

<u>Judgemental Shoot</u>

On book out day, we completed our second IPPT. The day began early at 0430, though the IPPT itself did not start until 0630. My statics showed modest improvement. I did 37 push ups and 51 sit ups, slightly better than before but less progress than I had hoped for. For the run, which took place on the track, I quickly calculated that gold was out of reach and opted for a relaxed pace. I maintained approximately 1 minute 50 seconds per lap for the first five rounds. During the sixth round, however, a sharp pain struck my lower left rib cage, forcing me to slow to about 2 minutes for that lap. I finished with a time of 11 minutes 6 seconds. It was a small improvement, and insufficient to change my run score. Overall, I achieved silver with 77 points.

Next came the judgmental shoot exercise. Working in pairs, we participated in a simulation where we approached a subject. One person would engage the subject, requesting identification and purpose of visit, while their partner maintained vigilance. The scenario could unfold in three ways. First, the subject cooperates. Second, the subject runs away. Third, the subject seizes a weapon from one of us. My buddy and I drew the weapon snatching scenario. As the primary interviewer, when the subject went for my weapon, my partner responded by firing twice at his legs. After completing our scenario, we waited for the rest of the platoon before breaking for lunch.

Finally, we had SBB. I received punishment regarding my towel, though the specific reason remains unclear to me. The sergeant did not follow up after I attempted to correct the issue. Despite this, the SBB went exceptionally well, with the sergeant later messaging us to acknowledge our excellent performance. We booked out at 1500 hours.

### Field Camp

I was determined not to be late again after the previous book in. We were instructed to report by 1345. Taking no chances, I departed just after 1130, reaching Beauty World MRT at noon and Pasir Ris by 1300.

With forty minutes to spare, I wandered through White Sands mall. It was my first visit there. Though typical in its offerings, it felt more compact than most malls, with noticeably smaller storefronts. At 1400, we boarded the bus to SFT. During our company gathering at the basketball court, four members of my platoon were called out. They had been caught using phones while on guard duty. The consequence was additional weekend guard duty.

After strength training came dinner, followed by last parade. With over two hours remaining before lights out, I attempted to complete my SRT, but was forced to stop at just one kilometer due to a sharp pain in my stomach. While doing push ups afterward, my buddy and I had a casual conversation with our attached sergeant about SCS, OCS, and general army life. I completed my night routine and used my phone until lights out. Just before the final call, I spotted two section mates eating instant noodles, which struck me as insane.

<u>IFC</u>

We began the day with Individual Field Craft (IFC) training at the SOC grounds, rotating through five stations. The first station focused on fire movement. There would be a three-person team advancing toward an enemy position. The IC would engage the target while the others provided covering fire and executed flanking maneuvers. At the second station, we practiced range cards. This involved positioning fire sticks to mark our field of fire, then documenting stationary landmarks like trees and bushes to determine the location where we would die in battle. The third station was cover and concealment. We learned the critical difference between cover (hiding behind solid objects like rocks) and concealment (using camouflage and foliage to blend into surroundings while moving). This station also included instruction on tactical hand signals for silent communication. At the fourth station, we were shown field shelter construction, specifically setting up tents and properly securing them with rope knots. The fifth station was focused on shellscrape creation. During this time, there was a sudden heavy downpour. We were completely drenched. My uniform, helmet, and assault bag were all thoroughly soaked. We eventually returned to the coyline for lunch.

Afterward, we were given time to organize our field packs, which included the challenging task of folding our wet assault bags to fit inside. Next came initial inspection, where we emptied our field packs to display standardized layouts. The process was predictably chaotic. I was among several soldiers whose rifles were confiscated for failing to properly backsling them. When a sergeant attempted to take mine, I pulled it back. Still, I was given a punishment of five push ups.

The day concluded with a detailed briefing about our upcoming field camp, followed by dinner and last parade. Despite multiple attempts after parade to empty my bowels to avoid having to relieve myself during field training, I failed to do so.

<u>Field Shelter</u>

I rose early at 0440, twenty minutes before reveille at 0500, hoping to clear my bowels. Unfortunately, all cubicles were occupied, leaving me unable to relieve myself. Thankfully, I was granted time after breakfast to address this necessity.

Following breakfast, we collected our weapons and underwent final inspection. Being assigned to the second deployment wave, we moved out after the two platoons in wave one. Our inspection concluded at 0800, but our departure was not scheduled until 0900, providing an hour to chill out. We traveled by bus to our field location. It was a remote site near School 4's rocky hill, then continued deeper into the forest.

Upon disembarking, we encountered an area with evenly spaced trees. The company gathered to hear the sergeant major and officer commanding explain what would transpire during field camp. Then came a traditional initiation. The sergeants poured water over the soil, transforming it into mud, and instructed us to leopard crawl through it. I had the foresight to remove my glasses beforehand, saving them from becoming completely muddied. My watch was not so fortunate, and it became filled with mud that proved difficult to clean off. After this muddy welcome, we dispersed to establish our field shelters.

My buddy and I were directed to our designated tent location. We began by securing a rope between two trees and draping our ground sheet over it to create the overhead shelter. While my partner secured the ground sheet to the rope, I foraged for four suitable branches, which I sharpened using my Swiss Army knife. I then planted these improvised stakes into the ground as my buddy tied the corners of the ground sheet to them, completing our tent. I harbored some concern about one side of our shelter where the stakes had not penetrated deeply enough into the soil. I was certain that side would collapse during heavy rainfall. Despite this vulnerability, our tent stood relatively spacious and stable compared to those of our platoon mates.

After setting up our tents, we gathered for a check-in with our respective sergeants about how we were feeling thus far. This was followed by revision sessions covering the five stations we had learned the previous day. During the range card station exercise, CAT 1 (lightning alert) was issued, forcing us to retreat to our tents for 30 minutes. Later, we received a detailed briefing on night guard duty protocols. The duty would be shared among seven pairs of soldiers, each serving one-hour shifts from 2200 to 0500 hours.

Dinner was at 1800. I had the water chestnut dumpling combat ration, which included rice and chicken. We were specifically instructed to eat with proper utensils rather than tearing a small opening and squeezing out the contents. This is a precaution against potential tongue lacerations from the sharp tin foil edges. During the meal, one of my section mates complained of nausea and refused to eat. The supervising commander insisted he consume something, which resulted in him vomiting.

We remained in position until nightfall before receiving instructions regarding body maintenance. The schedule included designated times for separate lower and upper body cleaning. For our uniform rotation plan, we would wear one set for the first two days and a different set for the first two nights. On the third day, we would receive fresh supplies, allowing us to use our night uniform for the subsequent two days and the new supplies for nighttime wear. Some platoon mates had joked about potentially seeing female trainees across the road during these cleaning sessions, but visibility was too limited for such things to occur.

When our designated lower body maintenance period ended, we were ordered to gather. One member of my section arrived late and unaccompanied. It was a serious breach of protocol of buddy level at all times. The commanders were furious, demanding to know his buddy's whereabouts. He admitted his partner was still in their tent, and that he came to inform them about it.

Moments later, his buddy emerged, concealing himself behind me, conspicuously shirtless. The commanders summoned him forward, their disbelief evident. They instructed his buddy to put on his shirt for him. No doubt a humiliating scenario for both. With unmistakable severity, the commander warned that any repeated infractions would result in consequences beyond merely assisting with his shirt.

The encounter concluded with a sobering admonishment. We had lost the commander's trust. Though he offered a second chance, he made it clear that further violations would cost us our status as Platoon 2 recruits, reducing us to standard recruit classification.

Throughout the entire day, we operated under strict noise discipline protocols, required to maintain minimal sound levels at all times. Additionally, our rest periods were significantly reduced. Instead of the standard seven hours of uninterrupted sleep, we would now be limited to just four hours.

<u>Shellscrape</u>

Reveille would be 0500 everyday in out field. I was woken up 10 minutes before by the sounds of my platoon mates walking around to ensure everyone is had woken up. We assembled for morning warm up exercises in the darkness. Positioned at the rear of the formation where sergeant supervision was minimal, I slacked off. And though we were required to apply camouflage face paint, I did not, knowing that it would go unnoticed in the low visibility. I also discovered my flashlight was missing.

After breakfast, we proceeded to the shellscrape station. Our platoon commander collected our assault bags and arranged them in a row between the tent lines to mark our working area. Using white tape, we outlined the dimensions of our individual shellscrapes, then established firing sticks and completed our range cards to document fields of fire.

The actual digging commenced afterward. It would be a three-hour endeavor divided into hourly segments with ten-minute rest intervals between. We were required to wear our Load Bearing System (LBS) and helmets throughout the process, though we were permitted to ground our rifles. I began by excavating along my taped outline, which we were instructed to remove as we progressed. The initial soil layer proved remarkably dense, requiring substantial physical effort. My platoon sergeant suggested that rather than dragging the entrenching tool across the surface, I should drive it forcefully into the ground, then leverage it forward to break up and remove the compacted earth. By the end of the first digging session, fatigue had set in. My back ached from the constant bending and soil removal. Despite this, I recognized my relative fortune. My section mate digging beside me encountered a large rock embedded in his designated area and had to laboriously excavate around it for removal.

I continued into the second digging session with renewed determination. My platoon sergeant offered another valuable technique which was to sit at the edge, use one hand to remove loosened soil before continuing to dig deeper. I immediately implemented this two-stage approach. First, soften the soil using his earlier method. Second, remove the loosened material while seated.

However, my progress was interrupted when I struck a rock. Fortunately, I had already achieved sufficient depth at that point, allowing me to simply cover the obstruction with soft soil rather than laboriously extracting it. Drawing on techniques I had studied in NS BMT official videos, I began shaping my shellscrape according to standard specifications. My sergeant later corrected my design, noting that I needed only one step at the front rather than the two I had begun to create. By the session's end, I had completed the forward section of my shellscrape.

During the third and final session, I focused on excavating the rear compartment. It was the deepest section designed to accommodate my field pack. The soil composition changed significantly here, transitioning to sand that yielded easily to my entrenching tool. This allowed me to work more efficiently, sitting comfortably while scooping sand from the deepening hole and transferring it to my sandbags. Some of my peers had dug so deeply that their positions began filling with groundwater.

Upon completion, my shellscrape featured impressive depth with a protective berm of soil encircling the perimeter. The quality of my work drew surprised reactions from both my sergeant and section mates. A few jokingly threatened to use the field pack compartment as a latrine, given its remarkable depth.

We had lunch at 1200. At 1300, the commanders conducted a fire movement demonstration, followed by our practice session at 1400. During field camp, waiting became a familiar routine. There would be abundant downtime punctuated by brief activities. Occasionally, I would find a comfortable spot in the shade and write in my journal, which I later transferred to this digital format. More often, though, the discomfort and lethargy won out, and I would simply zone out, chat with my section mates, or snack on our rations.

Around 1730, someone fainted, causing a safety stoppage that ended the practice. I had not completed my turn, along with several others. All those hours of waiting for nothing. The SAF truly tested my patience. But that is fine by me, for I preferred idleness to the actual activities.

After dinner, we waited for the dark before beginning our next activity on night movement. While most of the group proceeded with this, those of us who missed the earlier fire movement exercise were pulled aside to complete it. From what I observed, the night movement involved my peers walking briefly in circles in the darkness for less than ten minutes.

The day concluded with last parade followed by our body maintenance, complicated by light discipline rules prohibiting flashlight use. This restriction did not affect me since I had already lost it earlier. I wiped myself down, changed my underwear and socks, temporarily misplaced one of my garters and had to borrow a flashlight before finding it. I arranged my field pack in the hole at the end of my shellscrape, positioning my LBS and helmet at the top. After candy-wrapping my assault bag, I lay down in the shellscrape with my rifle to sleep. Finding the second sandbag uncomfortable, I removed it and used the first as a makeshift pillow, hard though it was.

Despite multiple attempts to relieve myself, the stomachache persisted. I mentioned it to the sergeant, who advised that visiting the medics would not help. I concurred. His simple recommendation was to just fart more.

My guard duty was scheduled from 2200 to 2300 hours. It was ideal timing that did not bother me. However, I spent five frustrating minutes searching for my buddy, only to discover him already asleep in his shellscrape. I woke him for our shift. During our watch, a sergeant came by to check on us. Around 2230, we connected with the Platoon 3 guards, talked for about fifteen minutes about our experience in field camp so far, then woke the next shift before heading back.

My stomach pain worsened, forcing me to visit the latrine. I went alone, risking punishment if caught without my buddy. In complete darkness, I navigated the small hole, drawing on experience from previous visits. After finishing, I found little sand remained for covering, so I used generous amounts of lime powder and dug hard soil with the shovel to properly close the hole. I think I completely rendered that particular spot unusable. Upon exiting, someone from another platoon (identifiable by their different colored light) spotted me and asked about my buddy's whereabouts. I claimed he was inside urinating, which satisfied him and he moved on. A lucky escape.

Though sleeping on the hard ground in my shellscrape was uncomfortable, I enjoyed a surprisingly good sleep that night. Unlike many others who bundled up in Gore-Tex raincoats, I found comfort in simply wearing my uniform with a light application of insect repellent.

<u>Fire Movement</u>

The test day arrived, and we made our way to the test center. It was located in the same place where we had been conducting all our activities. The first station was the range card, with a seven-minute time limit. Unlike typical terrain exercises, this one featured banners depicting huts, wells, and fences rather than just trees. My distance calculations on the range card were off, but since my sergeant was evaluating me, he simply waved me through.

Afterward, I visited the latrine with two companions. While they returned directly, I needed to retrieve ear plugs but could not find them. Waiting for the next toilet party, I eventually returned to find my companions in push up position. The sergeant instructed me to take my time walking back, seemingly unconcerned with my delay.

Next came the stationary fire exercise. We were supposed to prone behind a tree while firing blanks without movement. One of my section mates joined me, along with a female recruit. My section mate struggled with his ammunition pouch, visibly frustrating the supervising sergeant who helped with one strap before instructing him to secure the other himself. When he continued to fumble, the platoon sergeant lost patience, ordering the supervising sergeant to simply assist and then warning us not to waste any more of his time.

Upon returning, the day's supervising sergeant handed me a rifle. I recognized by its number that it belonged to someone in my section. As I removed my helmet to refresh my camouflage paint, which had faded from sweat, the sergeant called over the platoon IC to point out something wrong with me. The IC mentioned my camouflage. I believe it to be an unintentional self-sabotage, as the sergeant had not even noticed the issue until it was highlighted. The sergeant immediately ordered him to camo off and camo back on. I later learned this was the IC's doing it. The sergeant then asked what else was wrong, and only then did the platoon IC mention I was holding two rifles. Then they walked away, leaving me bewildered. Moments later, the rightful owner from my section came to reclaim his weapon.

Next, we proceeded across the road to the cover and concealment station. Our task was to hide within the forest while observing and documenting outside activities using the SALT format: Size, Activity, Location, and Time. In my observation, I recorded two men in SBO (Standard Battle Order) carrying two SAR21 rifles, playing scissors-paper-stone near the shellscrape at 070525, 1020 hours. Shortly after completing this station, CAT 1 was issued despite the complete absence of rain. We took shelter in the tent as directed. The CAT 1 status lasted slightly over an hour, during which time we were instructed to have our lunch.

All of a sudden, the sergeant instructed us to put our gear back on and assemble within five minutes. Our next activity would be fire movement for both front and rear. For this exercise, we ventured even deeper into the forest, moving off the road to wait in the shade beneath the trees. When my group's turn came, we headed to the road where sergeants helped us load our rifles with the blank magazines that we had prepared earlier and attach our ammunition pouches.

One of my groupmates suggested I serve as IC (In Command), and the sergeants agreed. While I understood the required commands and procedures, projecting my voice loudly enough was difficult for me. As IC, I would need to direct the right and left flanks when to move, and that would be challenging when everyone wore earplugs amid the cacophony of blank fire.

Fortunately, we were redirected to another area where I would not need to serve as IC. During the fire movement exercise, my rifle experienced an Immediate Action (IA) malfunction. My sergeant, who was supervising that station, assisted me in resolving it. I overheard him mention something about "triple feeding"—a term unfamiliar to me, as I had only learned about half feeding and double feeding. After clearing the malfunction, everything functioned properly, and I successfully fired all my blanks.

As we performed our empty magazine check at the exercise's conclusion, my sergeant asked if I lived with many sisters. Later, I realized he was commenting on the elevated pitch of my voice during the shouting commands. It was the same vocal issue that had plagued me during JC1 Project Work presentations, except now I was experiencing it while lying prone.

Then, we headed back, emptying our used blanks at the clearing point before waiting for the others to return. By then, it was time for dinner. We received our out ration. This means that we would be eating food prepared in the cookhouse rather than combat rations. The out ration consisted of rice and pork and glass jelly for dessert. Importantly, it was served hot. Finally, a proper meal. I had grown weary of water chestnut dumplings, and the other combat ration of mashed potatoes with peas was simply disgusting. Dinner continued until the dark, when we were repositioned to face a different direction for our next activity on enemy fire location.

For quite some time, nothing happened. I suspect the sergeants were setting up the demonstration. Then suddenly, a brilliant light erupted. It was a trip flare, as the sergeant major explained. This was followed by another trip flare demonstration showing what happens when positioned incorrectly, in front of a tree. It produced the brightest illumination I witnessed throughout the entire field camp, outshining even the moonlight. The exercise also included distinguishing between the sounds of different weapons being fired, including the SAR 21 rifle, GMPG (General Purpose Machine Gun), and SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon), each with their distinctive firing modes. The demonstration kept pausing intermittently which I believe were the numerous IAs occurring.

IFC Day 3 was undoubtedly the most challenging. Though our supervising sergeant never shouted or raised his voice, the experience was grueling. We were constantly punished for not meeting standards. Throughout the day, we cycled through various positions, including standing, high kneeling, sitting, and push-up position. This occurred because the sergeant was dissatisfied with our sloppy movement. "Helmets off, helmets on" and "Everything off, everything back on" were another recurring command.

The high kneeling position was particularly difficult for me. I had pushed my knee guards below my knees earlier for more comfortable cross-legged sitting, which left my knees unprotected during high kneeling exercises. The pain intensified after three consecutive days of this position. We had to high kneel whenever section ICs were counting strength or when sergeants commanded it. I had to constantly readjust my knee guards and alternate between knees to manage the discomfort.

During push ups, the sergeant made us shout "Standards!" with each repetition because our standards were dropping. Similarly, during crunches, we shouted "Standards!" but with the opposite meaning. Our standards needed to go up.

The ICs had it worse. My section IC repeatedly reported incorrect strength counts and was constantly told to drop. The platoon IC faced even harsher consequences. Multiple rounds of applying and removing camo face paint. Whenever he failed to report accurate strength numbers promptly, the sergeant ordered him to run to a distant tree and back before trying again.

As difficult as the day was, we were somewhat fortunate. Our platoon sergeant was absent due to conjunctivitis. Had he been present, we would have endured much more yelling and additional punishment. I could almost hear his typical response. "Bloody hell. All of you, drop. Drop! Drop!"

Despite everything, our platoon survived this grueling day. We managed to push forward, hoping the following day will be less demanding.

<u>GBC</u>

On the last day of field camp, I was assigned the responsibility of section IC. My duty was to count the strength of my section and report these numbers to the platoon IC, who would then aggregate the counts from all four sections and report the total platoon strength to the supervising sergeant.

The morning darkness presented my first challenge. Visibility was poor, making an accurate count difficult. Compounding this issue, my section mates did not high kneel in two orderly rows. I found myself repeatedly instructing them to align properly so I could conduct an accurate count.

After breakfast, as daylight finally arrived, we prepared for our final activity for field camp. It was the Group Battle Course (GBC). This exercise simulated real combat scenarios, including situations where a team member becomes injured, requiring us to provide combat buddy aid while maintaining covering fire.

We conducted the GBC at the same location as the previous day's training. While loading our blank ammunition magazines and securing our ammo pouches, our platoon commander showed a moment of kindness by placing candy in our mouths. It was a small but welcome gesture amid the rigors of field training. The fire movement drills, both advancing and retreating, proceeded similarly to our previous exercises, except this time we faced the added pressure of having someone pointing a rifle in our direction.

During the fire movement to the rear, one of my group mates tapped me with his foot instead of his hand as protocol required. The sergeant immediately seized on this mistake, declaring me "injured" and instructing my group mate to perform combat buddy aid. After my group mate successfully performed combat buddy aid and I removed it, I laid back momentarily. The sergeant remarked, "Still slacking," and delivered a swift kick to my leg. "That should be the real combat buddy aid," I replied. After completing the exercise, we followed standard procedure by clearing the used blanks from our ammo pouches.

Once the entire platoon had completed the GBC, we returned to our areas to begin breaking camp. We had to fill in our shellscrapes, which had to be inspected and cleared by the sergeant beforehand. We then dismantled our tents and packed all our equipment into our field packs.

Next came weapons cleaning. During this time, someone discovered a loose firing pin, triggering a company-wide inspection. The missing component was eventually traced to a soldier from Section 3 in my platoon. Of course, he got yelled at and punished 20 push ups for that mistake. Still, it was perplexing that he lost his firing pin when we did not even take it out. The only probable reason was that his firing pin was not placed properly when he assembled his weapon.

The final phase involved completely unpacking our field packs, LBS, and assault bags, laying everything out on our ground sheets for inspection. Then, we went back to check for Returnable Ammunition Item (RAI) before heading back for our declaration. Only after multiple inspections were we permitted to repack our equipment and await further instructions to move to our next location.

However, my temperature rose to 37.9°C despite resting in the shade. After hydrating and resting briefly, my temperature dropped to 37.4°C just before we headed to the situation test (SIT Test) area. We carried our field packs, weighing about 30 kg according to my estimate, for what turned out to be an 800-meter journey. What I assumed would be a short walk became the longest of my life. Exhaustion set in as my back strained under the weight, forcing me to hunch forward.

On the verge of collapse, I recalled a paragraph from one of Nietzsche's books I came across on Twitter. "The most spiritual men, as the strongest, find their happiness where others would find their destruction: in the labyrinth, in hardness against themselves and others, in experiments. Their joy is self-conquest: asceticism becomes in them nature, need, and instinct. Difficult tasks are a privilege to them; to play with burdens that crush others, a recreation. Knowledge—a form of asceticism. They are the most venerable kind of man: that does not preclude their being the most cheerful and the kindliest."

Upon reaching our destination, we gathered as a company, waiting for the officer commanding to declare "mission complete" before we could put down our field packs. Our platoon commander gathered us and asked us to close our eyes and visualize our families and homes. That was what we were protecting. He asked the usual question. "If not us, then who would defend Singapore?"

We received cards to write messages to our parents. One side featured the five days of field camp. "Amidst the test of training, our recruits are like diamonds being refined by pressure. Each challenge they conquer, each hurdle they overcome, brings them closer to realizing their full potential. Just as stars shine brightest in the darkest nights, their efforts in these tough times will illuminate the path to a brighter future." Alongside was an image of a recruit digging a shellscrape. It concluded with Lee Kuan Yew's famous quote on the necessity of National Service. "If you do not understand that you have to defend this, then in the end, we will lose."

In the letter, I described the four days of field camp and how I had learned to appreciate Singapore's infrastructure. After reassembling, our commanding officer delivered a similar speech about our purpose through the visualization exercise. Then, our sergeants distributed letters our parents had written at the beginning of BMT.

Many of my platoon mates were in tears, though I could not share the sentiment. My parents' letters contained nothing particularly moving. My mother's was her typical yapping session, while my father's discussed our pre-enlistment USA trip with some images. His letter was clearly AI-generated. While I do not mind using generative AI to articulate thoughts, his was conspicuously artificial. I could tell it was Copilot because it had a general writing style. Some of the phrases used were AI slop. And it was probably the first output too. He should have opted for Claude instead. And asked it to improve, then personally edit it to make it more specific like a human would write. Regardless, I still do appreciate the letters.

Our experience for receiving our letters differed from the conventional approach where sergeants mentally break you down before delivering emotional letters. Perhaps this gentler approach was due to having female recruits present. Either way, I preferred this method over being demoralized before receiving mail.

That night, we slept in the open field on ground sheets, two people per sheet. The exposed setting made changing underwear impossible. I rushed through my body maintenance to get to sleep early, finishing by 2200 hours despite lights out being at 2300. I slept at 2215 even as other recruits were walking around with flashlights shining.

Around midnight, I woke up needing to urinate but feared getting caught by commanders if I ventured alone to the latrine. Spotting another recruit wandering alone, I approached him. I found out that he needed to use the latrine too, but for more serious business. We walked together, and upon arrival, he had to dig a hole near a tree with his shovel, relieve himself, then cover it back up while I just urinated over the white strip. After finishing our business, we returned to our sleeping area where I quickly fell back asleep.

The field camp left an indelible impression on me. Activities like shellscrape digging and fire movement were initially enjoyable, until fatigue set in or obstacles appeared—like stubborn rocks that needed excavating or fire ants inhabiting trees I was using for cover.

I noticed curious contradictions in leadership. Sergeants constantly imposed tight timelines between locations, forcing us to run. Yet when the Officer Commanding spotted us running, he would order us to walk, prioritizing safety. This created a contradicting scenario. We needed urgency but could not actually move quickly. Sergeants demanded swift movement while the officer commanding insisted on caution.

My equipment created constant discomfort. My helmet, which we wore frequently, became perpetually soaked with sweat. It became smelly and uncomfortable. The fingerless gloves turned one of my hands dark blue while sparing the other. Removing the interior tag helped somewhat, but the discoloration remained puzzling. The knee guards presented another no-win situation. Wearing them properly protected my knees during high kneeling positions but caused pain behind my knees when sitting. Pushing them lower solved the sitting problem but left my knees vulnerable when high kneeling.

Punishment followed bizarrely arbitrary rules. Simply observing others being disciplined could draw accusations of "being interested," resulting in your inclusion in their punishment. Even smiling, a natural stress response for some, became grounds for discipline. People attempting to boost morale through positivity found themselves punished for the effort.

<u>SIT Test</u>

I woke at 0530, half an hour before reveille. Morning dew had dampened our ground sheet, and I discovered severe heat rash covering my body. Between my right index and middle fingers, small yellow pus-filled bumps had formed. Red dots peppered my arms and legs. They were not itchy, but my skin looked thoroughly damaged.

We packed our gear, candy wrapped everything, and placed it at the back of the field. Then, we formed up at first parade level at 0615, followed by breakfast until 0630. During this time, I witnessed a recruit from Platoon 1 standing and addressing his peers. "Guys, are you tired of hearing my voice? Can you all stop being so selfish? Work with me. Help me to help you." Platoon 1 clearly had the "premium" field camp experience with constant shouting and daily punishment. That recruit talked like an officer. Clearly, he was already for OCS.

Our supervising sergeant chuckled at this display while my buddy, our interim platoon IC, mimicked the "are you tired of hearing my voice" and "why are you all so selfish" part. Meanwhile, our actual platoon IC had stepped away to use the latrine.

After the Encik's briefing, we relocated at 0730. We were organized into teams of 16 for the eight stations, with two ICs per station. I was assigned to Team Delta, which had only 15 members due to one absence. Consequently, I would be paired with someone from Section 1 rather than Section 3 as my co-IC.

Following team assignments, we waited until 0900 for NSmen and civilians to arrive and evaluate our SIT Test performance. Each team would be assessed by a reservist officer and sergeant, with one of our sergeants monitoring for safety. The test protocol required both ICs to read mission instructions, delegate responsibilities, and manage the team through execution. Each mission had a 20-minute completion window.

At the first station, we had to set up a defensive stand at a tall bridge. Our team split into two groups. Bombers positioned explosives beneath the structure while covering fire teams took positions above. As enemy forces approached, we executed a coordinated retreat before detonating the charges, successfully destroying the bridge.

The second station required neutralizing electrical installations on both sides before enemy arrival. Our approach path was from the right, crossing what appeared to be a river but was actually a sand bed. Two fallen tree trunks were our only means of crossing. As the last team member to approach, I found no path through my crowded teammates and fell into the sand below. This apparent setback of becoming a "casualty" and retreating to the shade, proved fortunate. The team struggled repeatedly with positioning the makeshift bridges, losing one to the current and failing to secure the second. The mission failed after 30 minutes of attempts under the scorching sun. To me, it was time spent comfortably in the shade. To be fair the failure was not due to poor leadership from our ICs, but rather the inherent challenge of the mission itself.

The third station was a helicopter evacuation mission where I was one of two ICs. We needed to evacuate a casualty and solve a puzzle to restore damaged communications. There was also an ammo box that required transport. We placed the casualty on a stretcher and pulled it up to the helicopter evacuation point at the top. Later, we used the same method for the ammo box, tying a rope to it and pulling it up. It was straightforward, and the other IC and I completed it successfully within 15 minutes.

The fourth station involved a room with a door rigged with explosives, forcing entry through a window instead. The task required constructing a bridge from wooden sticks to access the window, solving a puzzle, and evacuating a casualty from inside. I sat this one out due to my high temperature, resting in the shade with my top button undone and pouring water over myself to cool down.

After completing these stations, we returned for mission planning. This was an individual task where we read a scenario and outlined how we would accomplish the mission given the conditions. After submitting our work, we held a group discussion. Lunch followed, and having run out of combat rations, I received a new one. It was Mexican cheesy fried rice. I was excited, especially after days of eating the same food. The change in menu was truly wonderful.

After lunch, we had new officers and sergeants take over as we proceeded to the fifth station. It featured three tunnels for an ambush mission. When the enemy approached, we were to use machine guns, matadors, and bombs to repel them. I retreated into one of the tunnels to escape the sun during this exercise.

Suddenly, there was CAT 1 and we had to head back. This time, it was actually raining. For the remaining stations, we did not perform the missions but instead received briefings from the ICs who showed us images of the locations. The sixth station simulated a helicopter crash site where we needed to rescue the pilot while facing enemy forces. The seventh station involved a river casualty mission with blocks positioned over sand representing a river. We needed to construct multiple bridges to transport everyone and the casualty across. The eighth station featured a watchtower with a casualty beneath it, requiring us to evacuate the injured person without being detected.

After completing all stations, we waited approximately half an hour before filling out evaluation forms for our teammates, reserve officers, and sergeants. We then gathered as a company in our respective details and waited for further instructions. During this time, we entertained ourselves by talking to the Chinese recruit. We asked if he wanted to attend SCS, to which he replied that SCS standards were too low and he preferred OCS. When asked what SCS stood for, he answered Singapore Command School, prompting me to turn away and laugh with my platoon mates.

We proceeded to ask about his favorite sergeant, and he named the Malay sergeant from Section 4. For his least favorite, it was the French sergeant, which was understandable given how harshly he treated him. His favorite recruit was his buddy, which made sense since his buddy was essentially doing the work of two people. His least favorite recruit was someone from my section simply because that person ran faster than him.

While others continued talking to him, I spoke with a platoon mate from Section 3 about his field camp performance. I learned that during fire movement, he had failed to learn his group mates' names and resorted to calling them "Member A" and "Member B." He even said things like "Group, finger up, save," which was insane since group mates needed to provide covering fire when someone moved to the next position. During his sitrep, he said "Alpha 1 KTV" instead of "Alpha 1 KIA" to indicate he had eliminated an enemy. During cover and concealment, instead of recording what people outside were doing, he documented what his section mates in front of him were doing. On both occasions, the sergeants had to turn away to hide their laughter. Such incidents seemed almost unbelievable and provided entertainment for both us and the sergeants.

Back at the coyline, we had to go to the futsal court and lay out all our equipment. We took some items to our bunks and washed the rest. My section had dinner first while Section 1 went to wash their gear. We went to Ninja Company to wash our equipment, where water was being sprayed everywhere, people were shouting not to spray them or steal their water hoses. It was a mess. Eventually, I washed my items and returned to the futsal court to lay everything out.

Our next activity involved cleaning our rifles, which continued into the night. During this time, we had some fun by asking the Chinese recruit to sing his favorite song, and he performed the RI school song. We were playing with him the entire time, which proved extremely entertaining.

On book out day, as we fell in, one of my section mates who had the sergeant rank appeared wearing slippers. The supervising sergeant was shocked but gave us another chance and warned against any further mistakes. We had strength training scheduled in the morning. The floor was wet from heavy rain that had started at 0400. Wanting to skip the session, I went to see the chief safety officer, along with many of my section mates. I was the last Platoon 2 person to approach him. The chief safety officer questioned why so many people from Platoon 2 were coming to see him. He did not even listen to my explanation and simply told me to leave.

When my return, the supervising sergeant asked for my 4D number. I later realized this was for tracking people who had fallen out. I suppose I was fortunate to have successfully avoided the training. Along with my platoon mates who had also fallen out, we sat inside the training shack and watched the instructors and sergeants demanding that the remaining recruits be louder. They told the recruits this should feel like paradise compared to field camp, while I relaxed with the other five Platoon 2 personnel, four of whom, including myself, were from my section.

Later, we prepared for SBB. Fortunately, they did not check fingernails since mine were completely black and impossible to clean. My sergeant was extremely relaxed, briefly looked at the bunk, touched the top of the last locker, and walked out. For the first time, no one was punished during SBB, though the same could not be said for other sections. Finally, book out at last.

Looking back at field camp, it was not particularly physically or mentally exhausting for me. Rather, my body simply had difficulty coping with the conditions. I developed severe back pain after carrying the 30 kg field pack from the field camp to the situational test site. Numerous rashes appeared on my arms and legs. My tailbone and knees ached from constantly transitioning between sitting and high-kneeling positions. Most of these issues stemmed from sloppy movements, primarily because the China recruit was always groaning and moving slowly. He later claimed he was mentally weak during field camp and lacked energy. My buddy eventually confronted him, telling him "fuck you" and be better when the recruit complained about being tired and asked if everyone was not equally fatigued.

Worst of all were my fingers. I got cuticles and all my fingers except the thumbs developed large patches of dead skin, leading to areas of peeled skin that would persist even after I graduate from BMT. And before I forget, unlike what movies portray, the stories about sergeants stealing rifles are false. I did not even need to hold onto mine and could simply place it beside me.

### IPPT

We had a late booking and needed to report around 1900. We arrived at Pulau Tekong at 2100. Before last parade, we only received a Games Day briefing.

<u>Route March</u>

We started the morning with BCCT. This time, we had rifle warm-up exercises. Instead of using hands and legs for combat movements, we practiced rifle techniques like muzzle thrusts and slashes.

Next, we filled up a form for our final opportunity to express interest in command school, followed by an initial inspection for the 8 km route march. We walked the first 4 km to Tekong River and stopped for a brief break. After visiting the toilet and forming up again, I headed back to where I placed my field pack and LBS. I did not even sit for a minute and we had to continue the next 4 km. I felt that was deeply unfair. It was not a proper break.

The final 4 km consisted of two rounds around Salabin. One of the officers made us unsling our rifles because he felt that some recruits were not carrying the rifle properly. Though lighter without combat rations and shovels (about 15 kg rather than the full 25 kg), the field pack still placed significant strain on my shoulders and back. The LBS caused pain in my waist even after I removed my belt.

For dinner, we received two drumsticks and 100 Plus at the basketball court. Afterward, we conducted BTP rehearsal, beginning with a demonstration followed by practice in four positions: foxhole, prone, squat/high kneel, and standing.

<u>IMT</u>

The morning started with Individual Marksmanship Training (IMT). I was assigned to Detail 7 at Lane 10. The training simulation included two different scenarios. Day shooting with lights on and night shooting with lights off. For each scenario, we practiced shooting from four different positions: foxhole, prone, squat, and standing. My first shots went wide. My loose helmet kept shifting, forcing me to constantly readjust my aim. Once I secured it properly, my accuracy improved dramatically. I finished with 28 hits out of 32 shots.

Lunch was field rations at the company line, followed by over an hour of weapon cleaning. At 1500, we returned to the barracks to await our IPPT. However, the heavy rain had triggered a CAT 1 weather warning, grounding all outdoor activities. The warning, initially set to lift at 1540, was extended as the downpour continued. As a result, our IPPT was cancelled and rescheduled for the following morning.

Dinner was served at the company line at 1730. Afterward, we had arms drills. They were footdrills with rifles. It lasted for about an hour. The evening concluded with our last parade, which ended early due the rescheduled IPPT. WIth reveille at 0430, lights out would be 2130. After last parade, I hurried upstairs to shower. While relaxing with my phone and some jelly after I bathed, one of my section mates received a call from our sergeant. A reserve from our section was needed for guard duty. There were three of us available but one still needed to pass his IPPT, another refused because he believed he could achieve gold for IPPT (he did not), leaving only me.

At 2100, I was summoned downstairs with ten minutes to prepare for guard duty. In my haste, I realized I was not wearing underwear and had to dash to the toilet to change. My section mate, who had taken the sergeant's call, helped pack my LBS while I quickly dressed in uniform and boots. Then I headed downstairs to meet my sergeant.

We walked to the TFT to wait for transport to the ammo dump, where I would begin guard duty. During the journey, I learned that someone from Section 3 had to book out for a medical review at the Naval Diving Unit (NDU). Our transport was a small truck with four seats in the back.

Unlike at School 4 Rocky Hill, there were no prowlers or sentries here. The setup was simple: six people total, working in pairs. Each shift involved walking to the ammo dump, completing one circuit around it, taking about five minutes, then sitting until near the end of the shift, when we would do one final round before returning.

The ammo dump had no phone signal, which did not concern me since I planned to prioritize sleep over using my phone. While waiting for my platoon mate to return and replace me, I chatted with recruits from Platoon 1 about their "premium" BMT experience. Our conversations typically revolved around our sergeants, fellow recruits, and of course, field camp. The walk to the ammo dump was through complete darkness. The sergeant used his phone's flashlight to guide us through a small forest section before we reached the road with street lamps. At the guard post, I met a sergeant and another recruit from Platoon 1.

We sat together and talked. The Platoon 1 recruit confided that he desperately wanted to avoid infantry and hoped to downgrade his PES to enter a transport vocation instead. Next, our conversation turned to field camp experiences. He mentioned that Platoon 2 had endured the worst punishments, which surprised me. I had always assumed Platoon 2 faced the least discipline and shouting. Yet, my conversations with recruits from both Platoon 1 and Platoon 3 suggested that my platoon had suffered the most.

The Platoon 1 recruit specifically recalled our brutal third and fourth days of IFC, when we were heavily punished and berated. I countered by mentioning how Platoon 1 had to leopard crawl on the last day. He agreed that was their worst day. It was apparently triggered by someone talking back to the sergeants. For him, the first three days had been manageable.

<u>SDC</u>

Since the IPPT began at 0500, I could skip it entirely. Instead, I returned to the coyline to shower and rest. While the IPPT participants went to the basketball court for breakfast, those of us who had done guard duty were allowed to remain in the bunks. I had another hour to rest.

Next came SBA. It was relatively uneventful as we only received punishment for failing to help clean the top of an absent section mate's locker. We departed at 1230 from Pulau Tekong. After we arrived at SFT, we took a bus to the Singapore Discovery Center (SDC), located on the opposite side of Singapore, arriving at 1400. The session focused on Singapore's history and our reasons for serving. My platoon had an elderly man guiding us. It was a yapping session. When all the instruction finished their session with their respective platoon, the company gathered at a mini dome. We were divided into five groups for a discussion exercise about crisis decision-making. During the exercise, we had to agree or disagree with various decisions for the various scenarios.

For the first scenario, my platoon sergeant spoke up, criticizing the discussion as too superficial and giving the expected model student response. After the group discussions ended, we were dismissed from there. By then, it was already 1700, and I was among the first to rush out, heading straight to the MRT station across the road to make my way home.

### Live Firing

We arrived at Pulau Tekong at 1800. After marching back to the company line, our platoon sergeant briefed us about the following day's Basic Trainfire Package (BTP). There was no dinner. We returned to the bunks at 1900 and waited until 2100 for the conduct brief, which ended at 2130 due to some recruits asking unnecessary questions. Since our platoon was having BTP the next day, we had lights out at 2145. That was only fifteen minutes of admin time, the shortest ever. I rushed to the toilet to shower, finishing everything by 2140, which left me exactly five minutes of actual free time before lights out.

<u>BTP</u>

I woke up at 0430 and fell in at 0500 to draw arms. We had breakfast until 0600, then were allowed to rest until 0630. After that, we walked to the buses for transport to the same location as the ISAD. When we arrived, it was drizzling, but there was no CAT 1 weather warning, so we proceeded with the foxhole demonstration at 8:00 AM. Next, we practiced our IA drills. I waited until 0900 for my turn.

There were eleven details total with about twelve people per detail. Only Platoons 1 and 2 were scheduled for the day, while Platoons 3 and 4 would go the following day. I was assigned to Detail 6, Lane 9. For both day and night shoots, we had four positions. During the day shoot, foxhole, prone, and squat positions were at 100 meters, while standing was at 50 meters. For the night shoot, only the foxhole remained at 100 meters while the rest moved to 50 meters. We engaged three different targets: Figure 11 (full body), Figure 12 (half body), and Figure 15 (head only).

I prepared myself for a waiting game, knowing the actual shooting would last under fifteen minutes while we'd wait for hours. I noticed others bringing books to read, but I knew I would not be able to concentrate with the background noise, so I planned to either chat with platoon mates or sleep during the downtime.

At 1130, I fired my first live rounds during the zeroing exercise, where we adjusted our sights for accuracy. We had four magazines of four rounds each, engaging Figure 11 from the foxhole position. Firing for the first time, I realized the recoil was stronger than expected. Without holding the rifle tightly and pushing the butt firmly into my shoulder, the weapon would sway significantly and scatter my shots. Eventually, I found my rhythm.

Lunch came at 1230. The mutton biryani was honestly one of the best meals in BMT so far. It was a real morale booster. Afterward, we continued waiting for the qualification round. I waited over an hour until 1400 for the qualification round. We had one magazine of eight rounds and would be using the prone supported position, engaging Figure 15. I managed six hits out of eight, missing two shots in the initial rounds.

Then came the day shoot. We had four magazines of four rounds each, cycling through all four positions: foxhole for Figure 11, prone and squat for Figure 12, and standing for Figure 15. I waited until 1630 for my turn. At the foxhole position, I missed one shot because I aimed too low, thinking I needed to compensate for recoil, but no compensation was necessary. During the standing position, I had three IAs because the magazine was faulty with a weak spring, causing the bullets to become dented. I finished and returned at 1715.

After all details finished, there was a reshoot at 1730 to help those who scored eight or below achieve higher scores and pass BTP. At 1800, CAT 1 forced us to stop. We resumed at 1800 with collecting RAI from both the 50-meter and 100-meter ranges. Since we were not using ammo pouches, spent rounds had scattered everywhere when we fired. After placing most of the RAI in buckets and handing them to the ammo ICs, we adjusted our lasers for the night shoot.

Dinner followed at 1830. When we finished, the sky was still bright, so we waited until 2000 for darkness to conduct the night qualification. We had one magazine of four rounds from a prone supported position at 100 meters. The first round had a red tracer that looked cool when fired. Despite two IAs, I managed to hit all four targets. As we returned to the waiting area, night snacks were distributed, and I grabbed plenty.

My night shoot began at 2200. The foxhole position felt easy with the target lights illuminated. As such, I could see clearly through my scope. But the 50-meter positions were in complete darkness, with only red lights flashing. My red laser was too faint to be useful. I peered through my scope, and when I spotted the light, I squeezed the trigger, unsure whether I was even hitting the target. Later, I discovered I had hit only seven out of sixteen shots, giving me 21 out of 32. It was well short of the marksman requirement of 26. Once everyone completed their shoots, we collected RAI as we had in the late afternoon. Then came the declaration. By then, it was midnight.

We walked out of the range to catch the bus, arriving at the pickup point at 0100, only to wait another thirty minutes for transport back to Ladang Camp. During this time, we entertained ourselves by having a guy from Section 4 do impressions of sergeants and officers in our company. The sergeants then asked the China recruit to make a "locked-in" face, which was hilarious. We arrived at the coyline and had to head to the basketball court to clean our rifles. It was ridiculous since we would be cleaning them for hours the next day anyway. After returning our weapons, we rushed back to shower since lights out was at 0230.

We had to wake up at 0630 for breakfast, only to discover that the cookhouse had not prepared enough food and needed to cook more, causing us to wait. We eventually had breakfast at 0700 and returned to the bunks at 0730 to catch up on sleep until 0930.

Next came weapon cleaning. Frankly, I have accepted that I will never clean my rifle to their standards—the sergeants will always find dirt somewhere. So I just clean slowly, doing the easy work and rarely expending energy to scrub the hard-to-reach, stubborn dirt spots.

After weapon cleaning, we had lunch out-rations. Like the previous day, it was excellent. We had Western food for the first time in Pulau Tekong which included fish fillets and potato wedges. Then we returned to the bunks to rest again since it was CAT 1. It was not even raining, but now I understand that CAT 1 does not depend on rain. Rather, it is about lightning risk, which can occur even in the hottest weather.

Our next activity was arms drill, basically practice for parades. We did that for about an hour, then had another break. After that came weapon cleaning yet again, though it was only half an hour, so I did not really mind. To me, weapon cleaning is something the SAF uses to pass time.

We had an early dinner out-rations at 1730. After dinner, we returned our weapons and concluded the day with last parade. It ended quite early, and lights out was at 2230, giving us hours of admin time.

Throughout the day, we had the China recruit do his "locked-in" face during weapon return and last parade. It was definitely hard not to laugh. Even the sergeants had to turn away to avoid laughing.

<u>SOC</u>

For the first time during basic military training, we enjoyed more than seven hours of uninterrupted sleep as reveille was scheduled for 0640. This late start was necessary to accommodate the extended lights out times for platoons 3 and 4 from the previous evening.

Our morning began with BCCT focused on rifle protection techniques. We paired up with one person acting as an aggressor attempting to seize the other's rifle, practicing defensive positions against frontal and rear attacks. The session was brief since our instructors arrived late. We then proceeded to the lecture theater for an infantry presentation, followed by lunch featuring the much-anticipated strong burger that everyone had been hyping.

While enjoyable, it did not quite live up to the overwhelming hype. The afternoon brought an air force presentation, during which our bunks were raided. The conditions were deplorable, with clothing draped over lockers, food scattered on tables, game cards strewn across beds, and bedsheets left loose and untidy. Our rifles were stored in lockers, but one member of section four had failed to secure his, resulting in confiscation by a sergeant.

Upon returning to our quarters after the presentation, we were ordered to form a line as if preparing for standard bunk inspection. The sergeants declared our living conditions the worst they had ever encountered, subjecting us to verbal reprimands and physical punishment before directing us to section one. We were required to clean and restore it to SBA, then assume push up position upon completion.

Then, we had precisely five seconds to move to section two and repeat the process. Those who failed to meet the time requirement remained in push up position in the corridor for reflection. We were expected to explain to the platoon sergeant why our bunks had deteriorated so badly and outline our improvement plans. This routine continued through all four sections.

Finally, we assembled in section four's bunks where the platoon sergeant addressed us about discipline, responsibility, and maintaining proper standards. The entire punishment lasted an hour, though the time seemed to pass more quickly than expected.

Following the punishment, we had an hour of rest before our SOC session. Rather than taking place at Saladin, the SOC was conducted at School 1, which required a longer walk. The session introduced us to the final two stations: the low wall and low rope. After the instructors demonstrated the techniques, we divided into two groups to practice.

I began with the low wall, which had appeared intimidatingly high when the instructor demonstrated it, likely due to his height. However, when I attempted it myself, I discovered the wall was quite manageable and required only a modest jump before pulling myself over. The taller recruits found it even easier, barely needing to jump at all. We then moved to the low rope station, but before I could attempt it, the weather deteriorated to CAT 1 conditions, forcing us indoors. The SOC session concluded abruptly, and we returned to coyline to prepare for dinner.

After dinner, our return march became unnecessarily prolonged as the sergeant made us complete additional rounds and perform repeated hentak kaki (stationary marching drills with accompanying songs), apparently without reason. This was likely due to the Malay sergeant's heavy smoking habit and his irritation from having eaten during dinner instead of taking his usual smoke break.

We then brought our rifles down to send arms before proceeding to the training shack, where the platoon sergeant engaged us in casual conversation. Meanwhile, section four was conspicuously absent, undergoing punishment from their sergeant. During this discussion, my section's Indian recruit who frequently boasted about his OCS aspirations and often caused problems for the group made a stupid remark.

He declared to the platoon sergeant that our section was superior to the others. The platoon sergeant disagreed, citing other sections' better performance during SBB. The recruit dismissed this as mere luck, which infuriated the platoon sergeant, who viewed this response as arrogant and complacent. He immediately ordered us to prepare for inspection, a completely unnecessary consequence of one person's thoughtless remarks.

At the bunk, the Indian sergeant directed the troublesome recruit to look in the mirror and describe what he saw. The recruit responded with "a clown," which startled the sergeant. We later learned that the sergeant had been calling this recruit a clown so frequently that he assumed this was the expected answer. My section mates began suppressing laughter, with one gripping the bunk bed for support and another nearly brought to tears from trying not to laugh aloud, as any visible amusement could result in joining the punishment.

The sergeant ordered the recruit to perform push ups while playing circus music from his phone, which he placed on the recruit's back. As the sergeant himself began laughing and encouraged us to do the same, claiming it was genuinely funny, the situation became almost unbearable. I closed my eyes, but the circus music continued relentlessly. I clenched my teeth to prevent any trace of a smile from appearing. Eventually, one section mate lost control and burst into laughter, earning himself the same punishment of push ups accompanied by circus music. He continued laughing even while exercising.

Following this episode, we were scheduled for field pack inspection in our quarters, but the sergeants appeared too tired to conduct thorough checks and essentially skipped the process. We then moved to the lecture theater for a briefing about the following day's 12 km route march. By the time this concluded, we had fewer than thirty minutes remaining for personal administration time.

While bathing, I overheard details about section four's ordeal. Their sergeant had been systematically throwing the belongings of the recruit whose unlocked locker had resulted in rifle confiscation. Items were scattered throughout the room and even thrown out the window, while the entire section was forced to repeatedly retrieve and replace everything in his locker.

<u>Route March</u>

We had our final BCCT session in the morning, which served as an assessment rather than a regular lesson to evaluate what we had absorbed over the previous eight sessions. The assessment was divided into three stations, with participants working in groups of three. At the first station, we approached as a trio where one person held the blocking cushion, another acted as the attacker against the blocker, and the third stood behind to tap the attacker, who then had to react swiftly and counter-attack. The second station featured a cylindrical boxing dummy.

During the first station, we demonstrated all the techniques we had learned throughout BCCT, from palm heel strikes to side kicks, while the second station required us to use our rifles against the dummy. The third station replicated the previous day's exercise, focusing on protecting our rifles from attacks coming from both front and rear positions.

After completing the stations, we waited for the next group of three and attempted to seize their rifles while they defended them. The entire assessment concluded relatively quickly, ending shortly thereafter. The whole experience felt chaotic and disappointing. After eight comprehensive BCCT sessions, this final assessment seemed inadequate and left us feeling that our training had culminated in something rather underwhelming.

Upon returning back to our bunks, we had an initial inspection in preparation for the 12 km route march. The sergeants conducted a relatively superficial check, allowing us to pass easily. However, the situation was completely different during SBB. The Malay sergeant entered our bunks and called out two people who had failed to complete their SDL despite three reminders. He ordered them to sit at the back of the bunk and threw chairs in all directions. He proceeded to ransack their lockers, throwing contents onto the floor, then instructed us to return everything to their lockers while the two offenders sat and watched us pack their belongings. We were given one minute but failed to meet the deadline. In response, he emptied their lockers and field packs entirely. After locking their lockers, he gave us another minute to pack everything up. Unable to open one locker, we placed all items in the accessible one. This did not satisfy the sergeant, who wanted each person's belongings in their respective locker, so he scattered everything again. When he left, we asked the recruit to unlock his locker and organized everything properly before the sergeant's return. He appeared surprised that we had managed to complete the task and dismissed us.

Lunch followed next. As we made our way to the dining area, some people failed to march properly, forcing us to perform extra rounds with repeated left turns, right turns, about turns, and hentak kaki. I was first to collect my food, but by the time I sat down to eat, it was 1150, and we had until 1200 to form up again. Needing to use the toilet, I had to finish eating within five minutes, rush to the toilet, and fall in on time.

When we arrived at the company line, the sergeants inspected our nails and facial hair. Those who failed the inspection, along with those caught using phones at night, were called out while the rest of us performed additional marching rounds and hentak kaki as they watched. I was already experiencing stomach problems from similar activities the previous day, having done hentak kaki multiple times after meals. We literally performed hentak kaki over ten times in two days. Finally, I could no longer endure it and fell out for a few minutes while the sergeants addressed us. We then moved to the safety corner for an extended discussion, where the sergeants reprimanded us for allowing standards to drop significantly after field camp. They emphasized their need to enforce proper standards and made it clear they did not want to hear complaints from commanders in other companies, SCS, or OCS about Platoon 2 Raven recruits from 02/25 batch.

We had another SBB session. Those who had failed earlier became the Indian sergeant's "assistants" and were tasked with checking our lockers. Despite finding nothing amiss, the sergeant instructed them to punish the rest of us with physical exercises. However, when I informed the sergeant that I was feeling unwell, I was excused from the punishment.

The sergeant then reprimanded the Indian recruit who had been causing problems for the section and by extension, the entire platoon. He criticized everything from the recruit's complacency in claiming we were the best section despite our poor SBB performance and his aspirations to attend OCS, to his excessive talking and inappropriate behavior during parade formations. When the sergeant asked why he was behaving this way, the recruit simply responded that it was because he was stupid. The sergeant told him he needed to be humbled and that his character required change. He then asked us whether we thought it was fair that this one person kept getting everyone in trouble. After the scolding, the sergeant ordered the recruit to drop the rest of the section as he stood, without needing to do the punishment.

Subsequently, we gathered around a table while the sergeant discussed the need for higher standards, particularly since conditions would only become more challenging ahead. After his talk, he asked what we had learned from the past two days of intense discipline. He then revealed that he had been protecting us from the Malay sergeant who was throwing objects around in other sections, explaining that he disagreed with such methods and would have reacted poorly himself if subjected to such treatment as a recruit.

Following this discussion, we had some rest time while awaiting further instructions. Heavy rain began, so we occupied ourselves with activities like preparing for the games day mascot, organizing our bedsheets, and preparing for our weekly safety sharing session.

There was supposed to be a CO parade in the late afternoon, but rainy weather conditions forced it indoors. As a result, the parade became more of a casual conversation rather than maintaining the typical seriousness of formal parades. Following the CO parade, we had to bring our field packs, LBS, and helmets down to the futsal court for the route march. Before heading down, I emptied all the water from my water bag to reduce the load, knowing that with my foot experiencing slight pain, eliminating the 3 kg weight of water would increase my chances of completing the march. After the briefing and warm up, I removed my belt to make wearing the LBS more comfortable around my waist.

We began the route march from the futsal court at 1820. The first four kilometers took us to School 4 Rocky Hill, which featured numerous slopes and a circuit around the compound's perimeter with many deep puddles. We then had a fifteen-minute break before retracing the same route back in darkness. Street lamps illuminated our path as we headed out from the compound, though we had to move aside several times for oncoming buses. During our return journey, we encountered an entire battalion from 1 SIR marching toward School 4 Rocky Hill. The stream of recruits seemed endless, and I estimated roughly a thousand personnel with camo on their faces.

Back at the futsal court, we quickly organized toilet parties for restroom breaks. Once everyone had returned, we received refreshments including a Mars chocolate bar, two fruit popsicles, and a 100 Plus popsicle. After a thirty-minute break, we set off for the final four kilometers along the coastal route, completing the march at 2200.

Even after arriving at the futsal court, we were not permitted to remove our equipment immediately. Instead, we had to listen to a speech from the platoon commander about the purpose of route marches, which he explained was to avoid enemy detection and develop qualities like resilience and perseverance.

Following his address, we had to spread out and display all our equipment for inspection to verify we had brought everything required. I was tempted to remove some items beforehand but fortunately resisted, as doing so would have caused serious problems. The sergeants conducted only a cursory inspection, barely glancing at our gear. Less than a minute after being told to lay everything out, we were ordered to pack it all away again.

We then received our night snack consisting of food and a packaged drink before proceeding to return our weapons and head back to the bunks. I rushed upstairs at 2300 to be the first from my section to use the toilet for bathing. Lights out was scheduled for midnight.

Reflecting on the route march, I realized how much lighter my field pack felt without the water bladder. The march proved more manageable than anticipated. Despite experiencing slight foot pain from the numerous hentak kaki sessions over the past two days, I pushed through without significant difficulty. Avoiding singing along helped conserve energy, though I occasionally participated when sergeants were nearby. Listening to my platoon mates discuss amusing topics likely made the march less taxing by diverting my attention from the discomfort in my feet.

However, the past two days represented the worst period of my BMT experience thus far. I found myself becoming increasingly frustrated and constantly complaining. I could not tolerate how a certain sergeant showed no regard for our wellbeing, forcing us to march repeatedly and perform hentak kaki multiple times immediately after rushed meals. Such treatment seemed unacceptable. Regarding the throwing of belongings, since it was not my property being scattered, I did not react as negatively. Being punished numerous times during SBB is standard practice, and anything less would be considered a privilege.

A recurring pattern over these two days involved those who made mistakes causing everyone else to be punished while remaining exempt from the consequences themselves. I consider it fortunate that my platoon consists mainly of JC graduates. If this had been a polytechnic or ITE cohort, the situation could have deteriorated significantly. JC students tend to be less confrontational and simply endure the hardship. Polytechnic students would be more likely to sabotage whoever caused their troubles, while I have no experience with ITE students to make comparisons.

When book out day arrived, we had mostly admin time in the morning following breakfast. The day remained relatively quiet with book out scheduled for 1000. During SBB, everything proceeded smoothly until the platoon sergeant examined the area beneath our bunks. He discovered dust everywhere, making it evident that we had neglected cleaning under there for weeks. He pulled out a duffel bag from under my bunk and claimed to see plastic, though it was actually paper materials like those from shoe boxes. Consequently, he had my locker pulled out and instructed me to examine the interior. Dust had accumulated inside for an extended period. He allowed us time to remedy our bunk conditions, forcing us to rush through the cleaning process. He did not conduct a follow up inspection, and our next instruction was to prepare for bag check before proceeding to the basketball court for the final parade in preparation for book out.

### Games

We had to report at 1720, but the bus only arrived at 1800. SAF truly knows how to waste recruits' time. By the time we reached Pulau Tekong, it was already 1900. We proceeded to the futsal court for our last parade and the sun had mostly set.

For games day, there would be a mascot showcase and cheer competition. Then there would be two teams of eight each for ultimate frisbee and dodgeball, and one team of ten for tug of war. We would also have a relay race with a team consisting of four recruits and four commanders. Every game required at least one female recruit.

However, many recruits had reported sick outside (RSO). Over ten were from my platoon alone, four from my section, and I heard there were 51 from the entire company. As such, the commanding officer (CO) mandated masks for the entire company. Looking at other companies and platoon one recruits with masks, it looked ridiculous. We would be truly nerfed. For the games day, the ultimate frisbee teams decreased from two to one.

I was originally a reserve, but with so many people out, I became part of the main team. Everyone was called out with no one left behind. I wanted to report sick to get light duty but decided to wait until the following day.

After the last parade, my platoon together with platoon four section two female recruits gathered at the safety corner to prepare for games day. We organize ourselves into groups for the different games to confirm participants, as many had either reported sick or needed to do re-route march or re-BTP. I was assigned to dodgeball, a team of eight with three female recruits. Next, we practiced our cheer and examined how our mascot "Raven Man" looked. For the cheer, we had to scrap our original version because it was too short, but we eventually managed to create a new one that was decent. As for the mascot, it was incredible given what we had to work with.

By the time we finished, it was already 2130. We returned to our bunks and I had my dinner. Shortly after, I took my bath. Lights out was at 2230.

<u>Games Day</u>

Since it rained during the previous SOC, we had to repeat it again in the morning. Having skipped the low rope last time, I never learned the proper technique. I struggled to wrap the rope around my foot to push myself up. After two failed attempts, I told the platoon sergeant I could not continue because of my peeling hand skin. He told me to just complete the remaining stations instead. After finishing, we ran 300 meters back to the starting point to rest. We completed everything in just an hour, well ahead of schedule. Since we finished early, there was a video shoot where several people had to redo all twelve stations and the 300-meter run, probably for SAF social media.

After SOC, we were scheduled for vaccination. Since I had diarrhoea the previous day, I was excused from the shots. Basically, I wasted two hours doing nothing. After vaccination, we had lunch rations before returning to the bunks to rest. We were supposed to have free time until 1400 when we would head to the games venue. However, our platoon sergeant made us report an hour early to practice and finalize our cheer. As a result, I only managed to get ten minutes of sleep.

Games day was held at the field near School 2, where I usually saw Physical Training Phase (PTP) recruits training. First came the mascot showcase and cheer competition. We were the first to present our mascot with narration. Our mascot was the tall guy with a hole in his lungs, narrated by the China recruit. It had a beak mask, feathers on the arms, and a bow and arrow. The other platoons combined their narration with their cheers. When Platoon 1 showed their mascot with a motorcycle helmet and knife, we shouted "cookhouse aunty!" When Platoon 3 displayed their mascot with a blue raven head, sword and shield, we yelled "guard duty," "sentry," and "prowler." We performed our cheer last.

We started with frisbee and dodgeball running simultaneously on opposite ends of the field. Each platoon fielded two dodgeball teams. I was in team 2A while the other Platoon 2 team was 2B. Dodgeball was played six versus six in a fairly small boundary. Step outside and you are out. Throw the ball and your opponent catches it, you are out. If they fail to catch it properly, they are out. Each match began with three balls placed in the middle and three players from each team rushing to grab them.

As the games progressed, more balls appeared around the field, likely passed over from the finished dodgeball game beside us. Toward the end of each game, it became a waiting game as both sides hesitated to throw first. The opposing platoon's teammates would stand behind us and throw balls back to their players so they could target us. Eventually, we had to do the same. This was honestly the least enjoyable part as people became aggressive fighting over the balls.

In our first match, I did not participate and we won with two players standing to their one. In the second match, I was eliminated quickly after grabbing a ball and throwing it immediately. I aimed for someone near the throwing line who was not paying attention, but my throw was too high. The person at the back caught it and I was out. We still won by eliminating their entire team.

After a brief rest, we faced the next two teams. In the third match, I sat out and we won with three players to one. In the final match, I participated and quickly eliminated one of the girls at the back, then another who tried to catch my ball but failed. They played aggressively by jumping, throwing hard, trying to catch everything. I eliminated one of the aggressive players, and another was taken out when my teammate threw a ball at him while he was picking up to throw at us. We pushed it to four against one. The last guy eliminated one of us, then it became mostly a waiting game. We began collecting balls and throwing at him when we got three balls. Eventually, one of my teammates caught his throw, eliminating him. We won all our matches. I found out later that the game was a decider for who would be champion.

When we gathered as a company to watch tug of war, I learned our other teams had performed poorly. Both our second dodgeball team and frisbee team had three losses and only one win each. Tug of war was a disaster. Two of our biggest guys had reported sick, leaving our team significantly smaller than the others. We lost all four matches decisively. Most games lasted less than ten seconds, and in the final match against Platoon 1, we were wiped out in about five seconds.

After tug of war came the relay race. Our team was stacked. We had our fastest runners and commanders who were strong runners. The China recruit was our starter since he was a sprinter. When the race began, he flew off the line, creating a lead that would help us win. However, the sports school guy, though fast in the 2.4km run, seemed slow here and nearly lost our lead. Fortunately, the guy from Section 3 ran unexpectedly fast, rebuilding our gap. The commanders performed well and sealed the victory.

Next came the winner announcements. For frisbee, the champion was Platoon 3, followed by Platoon 1, then Platoon 2. For dodgeball, it was Team 2A first, then Team 1B. The rest of the rankings were unclear. Tug of war went to Platoon 1, then Platoon 3, then Platoon 2. The relay race was won by Platoon 2, followed by Platoon 1, then Platoon 3. First place received medals, second place got hampers, and third place got nothing. Since my team won dodgeball, we received medals.

During the mascot and cheer announcements, we repeatedly shouted "it's rigged" and "cheaters" since we did not win. We trash talked the entire time. For the mascot competition, Platoon 3 somehow won first place—which was unbelievable—followed by Platoon 2, then Platoon 1. For the cheer, it was Platoon 3 first, Platoon 1 second, then Platoon 2 last. Our last place finish was predictable given that we used "Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)," which our platoon sergeant had suggested.

Overall, we came in last place. Platoon 3 somehow won the entire competition, with Platoon 1 coming second. Every platoon received hampers, but while the other platoons got multiple hampers, we only received one. Meanwhile, Platoon 1, with their numerous second place finishes, had the most hampers. After the announcements, everyone received a small Acai berry dessert.

Next was dinner, followed by arms drill as a company. But before the arm drills, we had to do sizing. That meant standing in a row from shortest to tallest, then numbering off. The odd numbers stepped forward while the even numbers stepped back. The odd numbers faced right and the even numbers faced left. Then all the odd numbers formed the contingent in rows of five. I was positioned near the right side since our company was not very tall. There were 25 columns in total. We performed arms drill as a company for a while before sending arms. Since my platoon was last to send arms, we continued practicing arm drills while the other platoons sent arms. After that came last parade.

<u>Graduation Rehearsal</u>

What was supposed to be a drill competition in the morning became a graduation parade rehearsal instead. Before heading to the parade square near the TFT, we had to do sizing again. When we reached the parade square, several other companies from Schools 2, 3, and 4 were already there. There would be eight companies total, with one from School 5 that would not join us for rehearsal.

I noticed the other companies were much larger and learned that the formation was supposed to be 10 rows with 25 columns. Since Raven Company was smaller with Platoon 4 having only three sections and we still needed 25 columns, the sergeant major decided to use five rows of 25 columns instead. We started with foot and arm drills. I was originally positioned on the perimeter, but my drills were not up to standard so I was moved inside. Then we marched around once to test our wheeling. Wheeling is a pivoting movement where the contingent turns as if rotating around a fixed point on one end. The inside person moves slowly while the outside person moves faster to maintain alignment.

Before the next part involving re-entry, we had to put our rifles back on our LBS and helmets into our field packs. For the re-entry segment, we recited the pledge of allegiance, sang the national anthem, and did the BMT roar. Once the chief warrant officer was satisfied with the rehearsal, we could return to the coyline to prepare for lunch. The rehearsal lasted for hours, from morning until noon. It was extremely hot and I was close to fainting.

We had ice cream during lunch, which was wonderful. After lunch, we rested with ice popsicles, and I ate quite a few. This was honestly pretty good welfare. Hot days definitely call for cold treats. As the duty platoon, we had to set up the safety stores—basically water points—and carry dumbbells to the basketball court for strength training. This would be our tenth and final strength training session. We did the standard warm-up, calisthenics, climbing drills, and dumbbell exercises. Since my hand skin was peeling, I only did pull ups and skipped the rest of the climbing drills. For the dumbbell exercises, I took the light 3 kg weights.

After strength training, while doing our duty platoon tasks, we watched Platoon 1 get destroyed because a recruit failed to lock his locker with a rifle inside. The Indian sergeant went crazy. He started slamming doors, shouting, making them run from location to location, and other insane punishments. Later, while resting in the bunk waiting for dinner, I learned from my platoon sergeant that Platoon 3 had also got punished for the same reason. Like lunch, we marched to the cookhouse as a contingent for dinner. After dinner, we had more arm drills, but at the platoon level. Before the final parade, we had to send arms. Since the company duty sergeant was our platoon sergeant, we got to send arms first, allowing us to rush upstairs after the final parade.

After I finished bathing, we suddenly had to Stand By Universe (SBU) because of a missing shovel blade pouch. It was really strange since we had passed everything down and counted correctly the previous day. Fortunately, our SBU was not too severe as we only had to empty everything from our duffel bags and field packs.

The following day's routine was completely messed up. We had graduation parade rehearsal in the morning and afternoon, and SOC in the evening. As such, I decided to report sick since it was not worth risking heat stroke or injury for a few pictures. Plus, the graduation exercise for the 24 km route march is coming up and I would rather skip the graduation parade as compared to graduation exercise.

After breakfast, everyone had to draw arms. Since I was reporting sick, I did not need to collect my rifle. Instead, I sat on the bench in front of the platoon office from 0640 to 0820, chatting with my fellow section mates who were also reporting sick about life after BMT and university. We reached the Tekong Medical Centre and registered. I explained my problems to the medical staff and went upstairs to wait for the doctor. I told him I had diarrhea and nausea. The doctor had me lie down and diagnosed food poisoning after just poking my stomach. I also mentioned my peeling hands, and he simply said it was normal after field camp and prescribed some cream. I received two days of Light Duty (LD).

We waited quite a while for the last two guys to get their medicine. They both got two-day MC. We returned to the coyline, and being the only one on LD, I had to go to the parade square near the cookhouse where everyone else was doing graduation parade rehearsal. The sergeant and I made our way there at 1020. Resting under the shade while the rest stood in the blazing sun, having to redo drills because the commander was not satisfied—it was paradise.

Afterward, we had ice popsicles, which were amazing. Those with statuses were told to gather at the safety corner, where the sergeant major announced he would allow anyone whose status ended this week to participate in the vetting and parade, even though they had missed two graduation rehearsals. All because one girl cried. And I guess there were just too many people who would not be participating otherwise.

We gathered back at the parade square near the TFT for graduation parade rehearsal. However, being on LD along with so many others (Platoon 5), the LD status became deflated and we became the duty personnel. We were responsible for setting up the safety stores. In the middle of it, we screwed up, taking Pegasus company's supplies, and the ice and water in the cambros were not filled properly. Eventually, we fixed everything and headed up to watch the rest of the rehearsal.

As I watched the seven companies perform the graduation parade, I noticed Orion company kept messing up because the chief warrant officer kept calling out Orion recruits for moving too slowly, fidgeting, or stepping with the wrong foot. I also talked to my platoon mates, many of whom were on long-term medical status. From them, I learned the art of "chao keng" and realized I knew very little about it before. I discovered the power of eczema and how to get certain medical statuses using the right keywords.

Later, due to the sergeant major's decision, I had to do arm drills. We had to mirror what the people in the parade square were doing, though not under the hot sun in the parade square, but in the shelter. After about an hour of rehearsal, many recruits started falling out due to the heat. I heard that not only were their boots burning hot, but their rifles were too hot to touch as well.

Next was SOC. Many people fell out there since they were on MC + 1. Then we marched to the cookhouse as a contingent for dinner. After dinner, we gathered at the basketball court for rifle cleaning. However, instead of everyone cleaning rifles, the platoon with the best BMT roar would send arms first at 0830. We locked in and delivered the best BMT roar, allowing us to turn in our arms first and have some admin time before the final parade.

Having experienced life as a storeman, and despite a few challenges, I found it to be largely enjoyable. As I knew what standing under the scorching sun in the parade square felt like, standing under the shade felt relaxing. Although I complain about the deflation of LD, and how MC is the new LD, witnessing my Chinese section mates' skin darken significantly or develop bright red sunburn marks showed me that LD still had power.

On the second day of the graduation parade rehearsal, more than ten people from our platoon wanted to report sick as we prepared to draw arms. Among them was my section mate who had rested in the bunk the previous day after reporting sick. This was unusual since he had never reported sick before, but after experiencing rest in bunk for a day, he seemed to have developed an addiction for it. Instead of getting ready like the rest of us, he sat on a chair playing Brawl Stars while coughing. Meanwhile, despite having LD status, I still had to draw arms and participate.

The morning rehearsal took place near the cookhouse again, but unlike the previous day, the weather was cloudy and pleasantly cool with rain threatening. Those of us on LD formed a small group and performed arm drills together while the main formation practiced in the parade square.

When the weather alert was raised to CAT 1, there was no rain yet, but the wind picked up and the temperature dropped further. This was honestly the most comfortable weather I had experienced since arriving at Pulau Tekong. We continued our arm drills at the platoon level in the safety corner, though not for very long. After the sergeant major's briefing, everyone had to tape down the excess straps on their field packs and LBS. Since I did not have mine with me, I simply relaxed during this time.

Lunch was bak kut teh, which was good. Afterward, we returned to the parade square near the TFT for more rehearsals. Rain was still falling, so we waited under cover for about half an hour. Even though light rain continued, the chief warrant officer grew impatient and ordered all seven companies to form up for rehearsal anyway since there was no CAT 1. Along with the other LD personnel, I continued practicing arm drills, mirroring the movements our company was performing on the main parade square.

When we returned from graduation rehearsal to the company line, I learned that the higher-ups had instructed doctors to standardize five-day medical certificates for Raven Company recruits due to the unusually high number of people reporting sick, suspecting a possible outbreak. Over twenty people received the five-day medical leave, including six from my platoon and three from my section alone. We then formed up as a contingent to march to the cookhouse for dinner.

The evening brought recruits' night, held in the same hall where we had learned CPR and AED. It was not just for Raven Company though, as five other companies were crammed into the space with us. Upon entering the air-conditioned venue, we received a "Speak Good English" handbook and a light-up wristband. The stage was set up with massive lights and speakers, creating a bright and loud atmosphere. The night began with buddy cam segments, followed by games focused on English pronunciation and sentence correction. The main event featured dancing and musical performances with popular songs, while the background screen displayed either animated lyrics or photos of recruits from key activities like field camp and live firing, taken from YouTube videos that MINDEF had released about BMT a few years ago.

A short intermission included another game segment about green and red flags. Once the performances began, I walked out and found a comfortable spot at the back to sit. I spent most of the time with my eyes closed, occasionally opening them to see what was happening. Frankly, I would have preferred admin time over recruits' night, as I have never been a fan of musical performances anyway.

During last parade, we received welfare in the form of Subway roasted chicken sandwiches, cookies, and Mr. Coconut drinks. However, everything felt extremely rushed. Just before last parade, we attended the Battle Inoculation Course (BIC) briefing in the lecture theater that ended at 2140. By the time we reached the futsal court for last parade, it was already 2150, with lights out scheduled for 2200.

Ultimately, lights out was pushed back to 2215, but we still had to finish eating and clear the futsal court by 2200. This left me with only fifteen minutes to put on bed sheets since Thursday was laundry day, shower, and prepare all the items needed for the BIC the following day.

<u>BIC</u>

I woke up at 0430 and could not fall back asleep, finally getting out of bed at 0450. Knowing I would not only have to participate in the BIC, which I was reluctant to do, but also that I would have to book out late since I had missed the last SOC, I had no choice but to report sick.

After reporting sick along with three other section mates, we did not need to draw arms and returned to our bunks at 0600 to rest until 0800, when we joined people from other platoons who also wanted to report sick. There were about ten of us in total. When my turn came to see the doctor, I simply mentioned that I was from Raven Company and had a cough and sore throat. The same doctor who had previously given me two days of LD asked me to open my mouth, diagnosed me with a throat infection, and issued a five-day MC to help control the outbreak. I later discovered that eight of us received five-day MCs, which meant we would skip both vetting and the graduation exercise, essentially allowing us to POP already.

Returning to our bunks, we found the LD personnel and those retaking their IPPT inside. My section had so many people on MC and re-IPPT that only three actually went for the BIC. Those of us on MC had to pack our duffel bags and clear out our lockers. While others cleaned the bunks and toilets, two section mates and I joined people from other platoons in sweeping the safety corner.

Lunch was served as out-rations at 1300. We had about half an hour to eat and clean up before heading down for the 1400 ferry. From what I understood, the BIC involved GPMGs fire overhead while participants leopard crawled, sprinted to clear rooms, and slid into trenches. It was supposed to be a relatively short activity lasting around ten minutes, but required full camo and would leave everyone extremely dirty, especially with the mud formed from the previous day's rain. Participants would then need to wash everything thoroughly to prepare for the graduation parade. Indeed, as the other five-day MC holders and I walked toward the TFT, I could see our company recruits returning looking exhausted with their uniforms turned brown from mud.

By this point, more than 15 people in our platoon had received five-day MCs. Combined with others reporting sick elsewhere and those on various medical statuses, our platoon had significantly shrunk. Starting with a strength of 55, we were down to fewer than 30 people. Many of us would be skipping both the graduation parade vetting and quite a few would miss the graduation exercise. Put into perspective, this seemed completely insane and an anticlimactic way to end our BMT journey.

After booking out and reaching the SFT, I noticed many of my peers were using Grab instead of public transport. I decided to take public transport anyway, which turned out to be a terrible experience. I got lost, and under the scorching sun while carrying a heavy assault bag and duffel bag, it felt like absolute hell. I went to the wrong bus stop, missed my bus when the driver did not see me waiting, and had to endure another long wait before getting off one stop too early on the next bus. While I eventually made it home, I finally understood why Grab was the better option and somewhat regretted not taking it, especially since there was another recruit who also lived in the west and could have shared the ride.

### Graduation

We were supposed to report back at 1230 on Sunday, but with my five-day MC, I would report back on Wednesday instead.

<u>Vetting</u>

The day began at 0600. We fell in, drew arms, and headed to breakfast. After eating, we had an hour to rest in our bunks before going down since we were the duty platoon and had to prepare the safety stores. At 0800, the pre-parade inspection commenced. The Commander BMTC then conducted his review, overseeing our graduation parade rehearsal until he was satisfied with our performance. This continued through to lunch. The afternoon brought the CO engagement session, followed by the initial inspection for the graduation exercise. With these activities complete, we finished the day with dinner and our final parade practice. We turned in early that night, knowing the next day would bring our long-awaited graduation exercise.

<u>Graduation Exercise</u>

Our final phase began with a 0400 reveille for an 8 km route march around Tekong in SBO. This was followed by a summary exercise that tested our proficiency in grenade throwing and combat buddy aid procedures. The afternoon brought unexpected challenges when rain soaked through our field packs during final inspection, adding weight and discomfort to our already demanding schedule.

Following an early dinner at 1630, we seized the brief respite to prepare mentally and physically for what lay ahead. At 1900, we ferried across to mainland Singapore for the grueling 16 km route march, now bearing the full weight of our field packs. The route deliberately wound through Marina Barrage and past the glittering towers of the Central Business District, offering us a profound reminder of Singapore's economic heart and the very foundations of prosperity we had sworn to protect.

As we marched through the night, those illuminated skylines served as both inspiration and motivation, transforming our physical ordeal into something deeply meaningful. The march concluded at 0300, and by the time we finally collapsed into our bunks, it was nearly 0500. The following day was dedicated to rest and recovery.

<u>POP</u>

For our Passing Out Parade (POP), we assembled at Our Tampines Hub, arriving early at 1400 for a 1730 graduation ceremony that required rehearsal preparation. However, as a re-entry, I found myself positioned with the other re-entries at the rear of the venue while the main cohort conducted their final run-through. The graduation parade itself proceeded smoothly and ceremonially, marking the formal conclusion of our basic military training.

Following the ceremony, we had the opportunity to capture memories with our section mates, documenting the bonds forged through shared hardship and mutual support over the preceding weeks. The day culminated in reuniting with my parents, who had witnessed this significant milestone in my military journey.

<u>Posting Orders</u>

The posting orders revealed the diverse trajectories awaiting our section, with our section dispersed across all four services in a bittersweet culmination of our shared journey. Four of us, myself included, received postings to the Defence Intelligence Service (DIS), while another four were assigned to the Specialist Cadet School (SCS) infantry. Our platoon's best earned the coveted Officer Cadet School (OCS) placement. Two section mates pursued aviation, becoming pilots, while another joined the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) as an engineer. The Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) claimed one of our own, and our final two members were posted to 1st Battalion Singapore Infantry Regiment (1 SIR) and automotive technical roles respectively.

Section 1 boasted three OCS appointments, notably all from prestigious junior colleges. This truly reflects the academic pedigree often associated with officer selection. Section 3 matched this achievement with three OCS postings as well, though one had committed to a military career through signing on.

The Digital Specialist Cadet Course (DSCC) drew heavily from our platoon, with representatives from across our sections. One from Section 1, two from Section 2, and another two from Section 3.

### Reflection

After nineteen years of civilian life, the abrupt transition into military regimentation proved challenging to navigate. Raven Company maintained high standards while balancing welfare appropriately. We were not stripped of basic comforts like the mono-intake recruits in other School 3 companies, who endured minimal admin time, nor were we afforded the lax environment of Orion Company, where low standards masqueraded as generous welfare due to indifferent commanders. Raven's commitment to excellence stemmed from its significant number of regular personnel and the Officer Commanding's desire to uphold the company's tradition of producing commanders. The rigorous marching sessions, though grueling at the time, ultimately elevated Raven recruits' drill standards far above other companies.

Our company's location offered distinct advantages. The basketball court provided ample space for activities, while our sea-facing windows offered views of mainland Singapore, including Changi Tower and overhead airplanes. Occasional stunning sunsets from the futsal court created moments of beauty. It was a stark contrast to School 4's dense forest surroundings. Living on the third floor, we had quick access to the lecture theater, enhancing our daily efficiency.

Laundry became a strategic consideration rather than routine maintenance. I did laundry only three times during confinement, preferring to rewear clothes due to minimal perspiration. While frequent rain during confinement soaked many recruits' hanging laundry, I fortunately avoided this predicament. Post-confinement, I adopted a system of bringing weekly loads home for washing.

BMT generated countless stories, from ghost encounters to comedic mishaps. Though two movies have immortalized the BMT experience, certain elements such as shit in the showering cubicle remain constant. Funny anecdotes proved more relatable than ghost stories, creating shared experiences throughout the platoon. These ranged from our entire platoon entering the toilet to when two Pegasus recruits came into our toilet, to a section mate descending in slippers to retrieve keys after we inadvertently locked him inside, to another section mate's night ritual of walking past other sections after lights-out, whispering "Recruit, still using phone?" to startle people from other sections.

Despite intentions to maintain a low profile, my tendency toward confusion and an unfortunate incident during the second book-in derailed these plans. Water parade duties exposed my vocal peculiarities. Attempting to project volume resulted in elevated pitch, leading sergeants and platoon mates to repeatedly volunteer me as water IC. The phonetic similarity between "Warren" and "Warrant" further complicated matters, as both platoon mates and sergeants began addressing me as "Warrant Officer," effectively destroying any hope of anonymity.

BMT's most valuable lesson centered on collective responsibility and mutual support. Individual failures became platoon failures, resulting in collective consequences from the sergeants. This reality necessitated helping struggling comrades and seeking assistance when needed, transforming survival from an individual pursuit into a collaborative effort that strengthened our bonds and ensured collective success.

The people encountered during BMT fundamentally shaped my experience, with my section mates proving most influential as we shared every moment together on Pulau Tekong. Our section included two recruits with prior BMT experience. One from School 5 who had already achieved Third Sergeant rank but upgraded his PES status to pursue pilot training, and another who was a recoursee after being declared Out-Of-Course (OOC) from Dragon Company the previous year due to pneumonia. A significant portion of our section consisted of Permanent Residents (PR) who had seamlessly integrated into Singaporean culture, speaking and behaving indistinguishably from locals. This demographic blend characterized the entire company, not just my section. And quirks like avoiding vegetables at meals was common among recruits and sergeants alike.

Each section cultivated its distinctive personalities and entertainers. Section 1's standout was a China recruit whose heavy accent made his enthusiastic lecture hall participation genuinely amusing, though his personal anecdotes revealed endearing social awkwardness, from requesting permission before speaking to girls to recounting third-person romantic misadventures that invariably ended poorly. Section 2 featured an Indian recruit from an international school whose compulsive talking occasionally landed the entire section in trouble, though remarkably, his verbal tendencies did not prevent his progression to SCS. Section 3's notorious character was a chao keng warrior who dramatically confronted Section 1's sergeant during confinement, triggering an explosive response from our Platoon Sergeant. Section 4 maintained more uniformity among its members, though different individuals rotated responsibility for various infractions.

My bunk buddy, a Vietnamese polytechnic graduate serving as an Air Force regular, remained somewhat distant throughout our time together. He gravitated toward other sections where his service friends were stationed and engaged in wayang. Only a few who wayang managed to gain favor with commanders and platoon mates. Most people who wayang earned mockery rather than respect. Concerningly, my buddy adopted smoking during BMT despite claiming his final cigarette during the last week, a habit that appeared to persist beyond our training period.

The smoking culture within BMT proved surprisingly pervasive and troubling. Nearly all commanders smoked, including those from JC backgrounds, creating an environment where many recruits adopted the habit. This widespread underage smoking seemed normalized within the military structure, likely driven by peer bonding opportunities and stress relief from rigorous regimentation.

Our section commanders presented diverse leadership styles and personalities. Section 1's sergeant, a Chinese guy from guards, became our least favored due to his approach, while Section 2's French sergeant demonstrated complete indifference toward his responsibilities. Section 3's Malaysian Chinese sergeant earned a reputation for skiving, contrasting sharply with Section 4's Malay boxer who never raised his voice but devised creative punishment methods. Our Platoon Sergeants embodied different extremes. One was a RVHS graduate who oscillated between explosive anger during mistakes and casual joking during downtime, and another Chinese sergeant nearing ORD who appeared only during field camp and select activities while clearing accumulated leave. The latter proved more intimidating through his sole focus on punishment without any balancing humor.

Attached sergeants supplemented our regular command structure for Sections 1 and 2. Section 1's attached sergeant, a heavy-smoking Malay whose mood fluctuated dramatically based on his nicotine intake, contrasted with Section 2's Indian attached sergeant who frequently visited our bunks for informal conversations. Over time, the latter effectively became our primary section commander due to the French sergeant's disengagement.

The behavioral contrast between sergeants and officers proved stark and revealing. Sergeants relied heavily on profanity-laden vocabulary, liberally using variations of explicit language that suggested limited communication skills. Officers maintained professional composure, rarely raising their voices. I witnessed my Platoon Commander do so only twice throughout the entire program. This reflected their different roles. Sergeants operated at ground level with direct recruit interaction, while officers focused on planning and program administration. Sergeant personalities spanned a broad spectrum, from completely indifferent individuals who avoided enforcement due to apathy, to those who balanced humor with strict standards enforcement, to others who seemed to genuinely resent recruits and sought opportunities for constant harassment.

The SAF demonstrated a peculiar institutional culture characterized by hurried transitions followed by extended waiting periods, creating an almost ritualistic pattern of "rush to wait, wait to rush." Safety consciousness permeated every aspect of training through countless lectures and briefings, while an overwhelming reliance on acronyms created a barrier where few understood the actual meanings behind the abbreviated terms.

As BMT concluded, the experience felt simultaneously brief and interminable. Recent enough to feel like yesterday, yet each day stretched across seventeen waking hours with only seven hours of uninterrupted rest. Pualu Tekong's temporal distortion created an atmosphere where time felt abundant despite constant activity through endless waiting periods, structured activities, and lecture sessions. The diversity of individuals encountered during BMT created connections impossible to replicate elsewhere, exposing recruits to backgrounds and perspectives far beyond typical civilian interactions.

Raven Company's high standards initially made military regimentation feel insurmountable, but my section mates proved instrumental in my successful completion of the program. Their consistent support throughout challenging moments and shared experiences during both punishments and lighthearted bunk conversations created bonds that transformed a difficult experience into something meaningful. Despite facing collective punishment when one of us declared Section 2 superior to others, I would gladly endure that consequence again to affirm that Section 2 truly was the finest section in our company. Every section mate proved to be fundamentally decent, and I never experienced personal conflicts with anyone—a testament to the quality of individuals who surrounded me during BMT.
