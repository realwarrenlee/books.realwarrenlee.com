### Summary

Atoms are an extremely small amount of a thing or the source of immense power. Habits are a routine or practice performed regularly or an automatic response to specific situations. 

Atomic habits presents a practical framework for habit formation based on four laws: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying, while also showing how to break bad habits by inverting these laws: make it invisible, make it unattractive, make it difficult, and make it unsatisfying.

Atomic habits break down habits into a four-part cycle called the habit loop: a cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response that provides a reward. The reward satisfies the original craving and becomes associated with the cue, creating a neurological feedback loop that reinforces the habit. The habit loop explains how habits form and persist in our brains, making it possible to intervene at any stage to build good habits or break bad ones.

<u>Habits scorecard</u>

Habits scorecard helps track daily behaviors by marking them as good (+), bad (-), or neutral (=). Say bad habits and their consequences aloud to increase awareness. For example, “I am about to watch a video on YouTube, but I do not need it. Watching the video will cause me to spiral into a rabbit hole and affect my focus on my studies.”

<u>Implementation intention</u>

Implementation intention is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. For example, “I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”

<u>Habit stacking</u>

Habit stacking links small habits together. For example, “After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” This allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behaviour leading the next. This works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable.

<u>Design your environment</u>

Make the cue a big part of your environment. Sprinkle triggers throughout your surroundings. Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you by training yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context. For example, only getting into your bed when you are sleepy causes you to associate the context of your bed with the action of sleeping, making it easier to fall asleep when you climb in bed.

> Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.

> Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.

<u>Reduce exposure</u>

Rather than relying on willpower to resist temptation, which is unsustainable, focus on avoiding tempting situations and optimising your environment to support better habits.

> You can break a habit, but you are unlikely to forget it.

<u>Temptation bundling</u>

Temptation bundling pairs necessary tasks with enjoyable activities. Dopamine releases during both pleasure and anticipation, making needed habits more attractive through the formula, “After [NEED], I will [WANT].” You get a reward only after you complete your work, making doing work seem more attractive.

<u>Join a culture where your desired behaviour is the normal behaviour</u>

We tend to imitate habits from three groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe) and the powerful (status and prestige). The closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits. Joining communities where desired behaviors are normal helps embed new habits through shared identity and social reinforcement.

<u>Motivation ritual</u>

Motivation ritual links habits with enjoyable activities through consistent association. Craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future. Creating specific rituals helps trigger the right mindset for different situations. For example, before a competition match, you go through your ritual of taking three deep breaths. Eventually, you will begin to associate this ritual with being in “competition mode.”

<u>Reframe your mindset</u>

To make habits more attractive, reframe them to highlight their benefits instead of drawbacks. Change your mindset about habits by adjusting how you think about them.

<u>Reduce friction</u>

Habits become automatic through repetition (automaticity), not time. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behaviour without thinking about each step, which occurs when the non-conscious mind takes over. What matters is how often you perform a habit, not how long you have been doing it. To build habits effectively, reduce friction by minimising steps between you and good behaviors.

<u>Prime your environment</u>

Make important actions the easiest ones by redesigning your environment. We naturally choose paths of least resistance.  Redesign your life so the actions that matter the most are the actions that are easiest to do.

> Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.

<u>Master the decisive moment</u>

Life's path is shaped by decisive moments – key choices that set up future options. Like highway ramps, these crucial decisions lead to different habit pathways that limit or expand future possibilities. These choices are a fork in the road: Do you start doing your homework or scroll social media?

Our options are shaped by the first choice. We are limited by where our habits lead us. Each day is made up of many moments, but it is really a few habitable choices that determine the path you take.

<u>Two-minute rule</u>

Start new habits small with the Two-Minute Rule which states that when you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do. It gives you a small way to reinforce your desired identity each day. This builds “gateway habits” that lead to larger behaviors. Focus first on consistently showing up rather than perfection. Once you master the art of showing up, you can improve and expand the habit.

> You have to standardise before you can optimise. You cannot improve a habit that does not exist.

<u>Automate your habits</u>

Technology can automate habits through one-time decisions, freeing up energy for growth and important tasks that require human effort. For example, deleting games and social media apps.

> People who do not have their habits handled are often the one with the least amount of freedom.

<u>Increase friction</u>

Eliminate bad habits by making them impractical to perform. Increase the friction until you do not even have the option to act.

<u>Commitment devices</u>

Commitment devices enable you to take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation. It is a choice you make in the present that locks in better habits in the future.

<u>Reinforcement</u>

Behaviors that feel rewarding are more likely to become habits. Our brains favour immediate rewards over future benefits. While good habits have immediate costs and delayed rewards, bad habits offer instant gratification but future consequences. The Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change states that what is immediately rewarded is repeated and what is immediately punished is avoided. For habits to stick, they must provide some immediate satisfaction, however small.

<u>Make “doing nothing” enjoyable</u>

Habits of avoidance are tough since they lack visible progress or satisfaction. To maintain these habits, make the avoidance visible and pair them with immediate rewards that align with long-term goals. While rewards can initiate habits, lasting change comes from identity-based motivation.

<u>Habit tracker</u>

Habit trackers provide visible progress by recording daily habit completion, typically through calendar cross-offs. Habit tracking creates a visual cue that can remind you to act (obvious), is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and do not want to lose it (attractive) and feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit (satisfying). While tracking itself becomes a second habit, it should be automated when possible and manually tracked only for key habits. Track immediately after completion and choose metrics carefully. Measurements should guide progress without becoming obsessive – they are just one feedback component in your habit system.

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

> But just because you can measure something does not mean it is the most important thing. And just because you cannot measure something does not mean it is not important at all.

<u>Never miss twice</u>

Life will inevitably disrupt habits. The key is quick recovery – missing once is an accident, missing twice is the start of a new habit. Success is not about never failing, but about rebounding quickly. A fast return to good habits after breaking them is what separates achievement from failure.

> The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

<u>Accountability partner</u>

Bad habits persist when consequences are delayed. Making punishments immediate and adding social accountability increases motivation to change. People avoid disappointing others since social approval matters, so having observers makes you more likely to follow through on commitments.

<u>Habit contract</u>

Pain and punishment drive behavioral change. When failures hurt, they get addressed quickly. The severity of consequences must match the behavior being corrected. For habits to form, inaction must cost more than action. Habit contracts formalise commitments and add social pressure by making failures public.

### Lessons

<u>Power of compounding</u>

Small daily improvements compound dramatically – 1% better each day yields 37x improvement in a year. 

> When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it - but all that had gone before.

Progress often is not visible immediately but accumulates through consistent small efforts. Making daily 1% improvements, though subtle, leads to significant long-term growth.

> Small habits do not add up. They compound. That is the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results

<u>Forget about goal, focus on system</u>

Focus on systems over goals. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. Goals have drawbacks: both winners and losers share them, they provide momentary change, restrict happiness, and can hinder long-term progress. Success comes from committing to effective systems rather than just setting ambitious goals. 

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

> The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

<u>Build identity-based habits</u>

Build habits based on identity rather than outcomes. Focus on who you wish to become, not what you want to achieve. Changing your beliefs play a key role in the shift to identity-based habits. This requires unlearning, continuously editing your beliefs and to upgrade and expand your identity. Two key steps to changing your beliefs:

1. Decide who you want to be.
2. Prove it through small wins.

Your identity emerges out of your habits. Each action is a vote for the person you want to become. Guide choices by asking “What would [desired identity] do?” The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.

> Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

> Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs and expand your identity.

> Habits can help you achieve all these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone.

<u>Plateau of latent potential</u>

Progress is not always linear. Our results are often delayed. The “valley of disappointment” is the period where we feel discouraged after putting in lots of work without experiencing results. But this work is not wasted, it is being stored.

> An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.

<u>Choose the right field</u>

Choose activities aligned with your natural talents and interests. Pick behaviours that align with your personality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy. Identify your ideal field by asking: What is fun for you but work for others? What makes you lose track of time? Where do you outperform others? What comes naturally to you? The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you. Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. If you cannot find a game that favours you, create one.

The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on the tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.

> Genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity.

> Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.

> People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them.

<u>Boredom is the greatest threat</u>

Success is often derailed by boredom, not failure. When habits become mundane, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty. Successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. Mastery requires practice. But the more you practise something, the more boring it becomes.

To sustain interest, find a new detail to obsess over related to the habit, or increase intensity and volume while keeping the habit constant. The way to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way every time. The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom. Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains.

> Professionals stick to the schedule. Amateurs let life get in the way.

> It is easy to train when you feel good, but it is crucial to show up when you do not feel like it – even if you do than you hope.

<u>Consequences of good habits</u>

Good habits can become automatic, which helps focus on advanced details but risks mindless repetition and missed improvements. We assume that we are getting better when in fact, we are just gaining experience, not improving. True mastery requires both automatic habits and deliberate practice.

**Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery**

Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalised the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. Each habit unlocks the next level of performance.

Reflection helps avoid complacency by reviewing progress, values, and areas for growth. What went well this year? What did not go so well this year? What did I learn? Revisit your core values. What are the core values that drive my life and work? How am I living and working with integrity right now? How can I set a higher standard in the future? Reflection indicates when to advance and when to return to fundamentals. It brings a sense of perspective.

While identity-based habits are powerful, they can create rigidity. The more sacred an idea is to us – the more deeply it is tied to our identity – the more strongly we will defend it against criticism. Stay flexible by defining identity broadly. Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you. A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.

> Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.

<u>Miscellaneous</u>

> Happiness is simply the absence of desire.

> Peace occurs when you do not turn your observations into problems.

> With a big enough why you can overcome any how.

> Being curious is better than being smart.

> Emotions drive behaviour.

> Suffering drives progress.

> Your actions reveal how badly you want something.

> Our expectations determine our satisfaction.

> The pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation.

> Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance.
