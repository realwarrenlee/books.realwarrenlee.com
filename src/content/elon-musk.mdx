### Summary

The book offers an in-depth look at Elon Musk’s life—from his difficult upbringing in South Africa to becoming the driving force behind companies like PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and X (formerly Twitter). Through extensive interviews with Musk, his family, friends, employees, and critics, Walter Isaacson portrays Musk as a paradoxical figure: brilliant yet volatile, inspiring yet intimidating, capable of both extraordinary vision and harsh leadership. The biography explores how Musk’s relentless intensity, engineering-first mindset, and appetite for risk have shaped both groundbreaking innovations and major controversies.

### Lessons

<u>The algorithm</u>

The algorithm is a 5 point checklist by Elon Musk, shaped by the lessons he learned during the production hell surges at the Nevada and Fremont factories. The algorithm is his repeated mantra when developing products.

1. **Question every requirement**

Each requirement should come with the name of the person who made it. Never accept that a requirement came from a department, such as from “the legal department” or “the safety department.” Know the name of the real person who made that requirement, then question the requirement. Requirements from smart people are the most dangerous, because people are less likely to question them. And make the requirements less dumb.

*Battery packs, Nevada factory*

When the battery packs were completed in Nevada, little plastic caps were put on the prongs that would plug it into the car. When the battery got to the Fremont car-assembly factory, the plastic caps were removed and discarded. Sometimes, they would run out of caps in Nevada and have to hold up shipment of the batteries.

When Elon Musk asked why the caps existed, he was told they had been specified to make sure the pins did not get bent.

“Who specified that requirement?” he asked. The factory team scrambled to find out, but they weren’t able to come up with a name.

“So delete them,” Musk said. They did, and it turned out they never had a problem with bent pins.

*Fibreglass, Nevada factory*

“What the hell are these strips for?” Elon Musk said as he was trying to visualise why fibreglass pieces were needed between the battery and the floor pan. The engineering team told him that it had been specified by the noise reduction team to cut down on vibration.

So he called the noise reduction team, which told him that the specification came from the engineering team to reduce the risk of fire. He ordered them to record the sound inside a car without the fibreglass and then with the fibreglass.

“See if you can tell the difference,” he told them. They could not.

*Assembly line, Fremont factory*

Elon Musk had a monitor that showed each station on the assembly line with a green or red light indicating whether it was flowing properly. As he walked down the line, he headed at any red light he saw.

*What's the problem?* A part was missing.

*Who's in charge of that part?* Get him over here.

*A sensor keeps tripping. Who calibrated it?* Find someone who can open the console.

*Can we adjust the settings? Why do we even need that fucking sensor?*

*Why do we have four bolts there? Who set that specification? Can we do it with two?* Try it.

2. **Delete any part or process you can**

You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you did not delete enough.

*Bolts, Fremont factory*

Elon Musk was sitting cross-legged underneath the elevated conveyor moving car bodies down the line. Again, he was struck by the number of bolts that had been specified.

“Why are there six there?” Elon Musk asked, pointing.

“To make it stable in a crash,” one of the executives replied.

“No, the main crash load would come through this rail,” Elon Musk explained. He had visualised where all the pressure points would be and started rattling off the tolerance numbers at each spot.

*Painting process, Fremont factory*

One part of the painting process, an electrocoat bath, involved dipping the shell of the car into a tank. Areas of the car shell have small holes so that the cavities will drain after the dipping. These holes are then plugged with patches made of synthetic rubber, known as butyl patches.

“Why are we applying these?” Elon Musk asked one of the line managers, who replied that it had been specified by the vehicle structures department. He summoned the head of that department.

“What the hell are these for?” he demanded. “They’re slowing the whole damn line.”

He was told that in a flood, if the water is higher than the floorboards, the butyl patches help prevent the floor from getting too wet.

“That’s insane,” He responded. “Once in ten years there will be such a flood. When it happens, the floor mats can get wet.” The patches were deleted.

*Safety sensors, Fremont factory*

The production lines often halted when safety sensors were triggered. Elon Musk decided they were too sensitive, tripping when there was no real problem. He tested some of them to see if something small like a piece of paper falling past the sensor could trigger a stoppage. This led to a crusade to weed out sensors in both Tesla cars and SpaceX rockets.

“Unless a sensor is absolutely needed to start an engine or safely stop an engine before it explodes, it must be deleted,” he wrote in an email to SpaceX engineers.

“Going forward, anyone who puts a sensor (or anything) on the engine that isn’t obviously critical will be asked to leave.”

3. **Simplify and optimise**

This should come after step two. A common mistake is to simplify and optimise a part or a process that should not exist.

*Assembly line, Fremont factory*

At another of the stations, the partially completed auto bodies were bolted to a skid that moved them through the final assembly process. The robotic arms tightening the bolts were moving too slowly.

“Even I could do it faster,” Elon Musk said. He told the workers to see what the settings were for the bolt drivers. But nobody knew how to open the control console.

“Okay,” he said, “I'm just going to just stand here until we find someone who can bring up that console.”

Finally a technician was found who knew how to access the robot's controls. Elon Musk discovered that the robot was set to 20 percent of its maximum speed and that the default settings instructed the arm to turn the bolt backward twice before spinning it forward to tighten.

“Factory settings are always idiotic,” he said. So he quickly rewrote the code to delete the backward turns. Then he set the speed to 100 percent capacity. That started to strip the threads, so he dialled it back to 70 percent. It worked fine and cut the time it took to bolt the cars to the skids by more than half.

43. **Accelerate cycle time**

Every process can be speeded up. But only do this after you have followed the first three steps.

*Nevada and Fremont factories*

Elon Musk mistakenly spent a lot of time accelerating processes that he later realised should have been deleted.

5. **Automate**

That comes last. The big mistake in Nevada and at Fremont was to automate every step. They should have waited until all the requirements had been questioned, parts and processes deleted, and the bugs were shaken out.

*Battery, Nevada factory*

Elon Musk learned that there are certain tasks, sometimes very simple ones, that humans do better than robots. We can use our eyes to look around a room and find just the right tool we need. Then we can weave our way over, pick it up with our fingers and thumb, eyeball the right spot to use it, and guide it there with our arm. Easy, right? Not for a robot, however good its cameras are. Such is the perils of pursuing automation too relentlessly.

*Windows, Fremont factory*

Near the end of the final assembly line were robotic arms trying to adjust the little seals around the windows. They were having a hard time. One day, after standing silently in front of the balky robotics for a few minutes, Elon Musk tried doing the task with his own hands. It was easy for a human. He issued an order, similar to the one he had given in Nevada.

“You have seventy-two hours to remove every unnecessary machine," he declared.

The robot removal started grimly. People had a lot vested in the machines. But then it became like a game. He started walking down the conveyor line, wielding a can of orange spray paint.

“Go or stay?” he would ask. If the answer was “go,” the piece would be marked with an orange X, and workers would tear it off the line.

Elon Musk took responsibility for the over-automation. He even announced it publicly.

“Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake,” he tweeted. “To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.”

The algorithm was accompanied by a few corollaries, among them:

1. **All technical managers must have hands-on experience.**

For example, managers of software teams must spend at least 20% of their time coding. Solar roof managers must spend time on roofs doing installations. Otherwise they are like a cavalry leader who cannot ride a horse or a general who cannot use a sword.

*SolarCity*

Elon Musk ordered that everyone on an installation team, even the engineers and managers, had to spend time drilling and hammering and sweating with the other workers.

2. **Comradery is dangerous.**

It makes it hard for people to challenge each other's work. There is a tendency to not want to throw a colleague under the bus. That needs to be avoided.

“It is not your job to make people on your team love you. In fact, that is counterproductive.”

3. **It is okay to be wrong. Just do not be confident and wrong.**

4. **Never ask your troops to do something you are not willing to do.**

5. **Whenever there are problems to solve, do not just meet with your managers. Do a skip level, where you meet with the level right below your managers.**

6. **When hiring, look for people with the right attitude**

Skills can be taught. Attitude changes require a brain transplant. When hiring or promoting, Elon Musk made a point of prioritising attitude over résumé skills. And his definition of a good attitude was a desire to work maniacally hard.

7. **The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics. Everything else is a recommendation.**

> If conventional thinking makes your mission impossible, then unconventional thinking is necessary.

<u>Hardcore</u>

If you want to be successful, you must be extremely dedicated and committed to your work.

Elon Musk is a demanding manager, contemptuous of the concept of work-life balance. He often drove himself relentlessly all day and through much of the night, without vacations, and expected others to do the same. These are the sacrifices he made to ensure his companies kept going.

*Thanksgiving, PayPal*

During the weeks before launching X (which later merged with PayPal), he prowled the office each day, including Thanksgiving and slept under his desks most nights. One of the engineers who went home at 2:00 on Thanksgiving morning got a call from him at 11:00 to come back in because another engineer had worked all night and was “not running on full thrusters anymore.” Such behaviour produced drama and resentments, but also success. Only with a hardcore workplace culture can companies have a shot at revolutionising industries.
However, being hardcore could result in some downsides. Elon Musk infused his team with his tolerance for risk and reality-bending willfulness. “If you were negative or thought something couldn't be done, you were not invited to the next meeting,” Tom Mueller recalls. “He just wanted people who would make things happen.”

It was a good way to drive people to do what they thought was impossible. But it was also a good way to become surrounded by people afraid to give you bad news or question a decision.

*Falcon Heavy and Starship*

Elon Musk was so pleased with the concept of Starship. During a meeting in the SpaceX conference room, he impulsively decided to deploy his burn-the-boats strategy. Cancel the Falcon Heavy, he ordered. The executives in the room texted Gwynne Shotwell what was happening. She rushed from her cubicle, plopped in a chair, and told Elon Musk he could not do that. The Falcon Heavy, with three booster cores, was key to fulfilling its contracts with the military to launch large intelligence satellites.

She had the standing to get away with such a challenge. “Once I gave Elon the context, he agreed we couldn’t do what he wanted,” she says.

One problem Musk had was that most people around him were afraid to do that.

<u>First principles</u>

When thinking about the absurd prices of Russian rockets, Elon Musk employed first principles thinking, drilling down to the basic physics of the situation and building up from there. He developed the “idiot index” which calculated how much more costly a finished product was than the cost of its basic materials. If a product had a high idiot index (rockets), its cost could be reduced significantly by devising more efficient manufacturing techniques. As Elon Musk puts it, “If the ratio is high, you’re an idiot.”

*LiDAR, Tesla*

Elon Musk resisted the use of LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and other radar-like instruments, instead insisting that a self-driving system should use only visual data from cameras because if humans drove using only visual data, machines should be able to do so too.

*Valve, SpaceX*

SpaceX needed a valve and the supplier quoted a price of $250,000. Elon Musk declared it was insane and told his engineer to make it for $5,000. And it worked once the engineer discovered that a valve that was used to mix liquids in a car wash system could be modified to work with rocket fuel.

After a few more incidents of suppliers “going Russian” on him, as the rocket hustlers in Moscow had done, SpaceX was making in-house 70% of the components of its rockets in just a few years.

All requirements should be treated as recommendations. The only immutable ones were those decreed by the laws of physics.

<u>Maniacal sense of urgency</u>

A maniacal sense of urgency must be the operating principle.

*Rockets, SpaceX*

Elon Musk insisted on setting unrealistic deadlines when they were not necessary, such as when he ordered test stands to be erected in weeks for rocket engines that had not yet been built. The sense of urgency was good for its own sake. It made the engineers engage in first principles thinking, but could be corrosive by demoralising them. Although such practices demoralise people, they ended up accomplishing things that other companies could not.

“Technology does not automatically progress. Progress requires human agency.” - Elon Musk

*Full self-driving, Tesla*

Elon Musk kept promising that full self-driving was just a year or two away because if he admits that it is going to take a long time, then nobody will rally around it and no one will design vehicles that require autonomy.

“Thus continued the tradition he had established at PayPal: setting unrealistic timelines that transformed his wild notion from being completely insane to being merely very late.”

<u>Surge</u>

At least two or three times a year, there is a compulsion was swelling inside Elon Musk to order up a surge, an all-in burst of round-the-clock activity, like he had done at the Nevada battery factory, the Fremont car-assembly plant, and the autonomous-driving team offices, and would later do in the crazed month after he bought Twitter. The goal was to shake things up and extrude shit out of the system.

*Launchpad, SpaceX*

Elon Musk and a group of his top managers went down the road to the launchpad site and did not see anybody working. This might not have seemed unusual to most people on a late Friday night, but he erupted.

“Why is no one working?”

“What is the fucking problem?”

“I want to see activity.”

He ordered the surge. Starship's booster and second stage, he said, should be rolled out of the manufacturing bays and stacked on the launchpad within ten days. He wanted five hundred workers from around SpaceX (Cape Canaveral, Los Angeles, Seattle) to be flown immediately to Boca Chica and thrown into the breach.

“This is not a volunteer organisation,” he said. “We are not selling Girl Scout cookies. Get them here now.”

When he called Gwynne Shotwell, who was in bed in Los Angeles, to figure out what workers and supervisors would come to Boca Chica, she protested that the engineers at the Cape still had Falcon 9 launches to prepare for. He ordered them delayed. The surge was his priority.

Shortly after 01:00, he sent out an email titled “Starship Surge” to all SpaceX employees. “Anyone who is not working on other obviously critical path projects at SpaceX should shift immediately to work on the first Starship orbit,” he wrote. “Please fly, drive, or get here by any means possible.”

By the time he got back from the launchpad to the Starbase main building, the video monitor by the front door had been reprogrammed. It read, "Ship+Rocket Stacked T –196h 44m 23s,” and was counting to the seconds. Elon Musk does not round off into days or even hours. Every second counted.

“We need to get to Mars before I die,” he said. “There’s no forcing function for getting us to Mars other than us, and sometimes that means me.”

The surge was successful. In just over ten days, the booster and spacecraft of Starship were stacked on the launchpad. It was also a bit pointless. The rocket was not yet capable of flying, and stacking it did not force the FAA to rush its approval. But the ginned-up crisis pushed the team to remain hardcore, and it provided him with a bit of the drama that his headspace craves.

“I feel renewed faith in the future of humanity," he said that evening. Another storm had passed.

*1337 engine, SpaceX*

Elon Musk declared a surge for the SpaceX 1337 engine even though the Raptor engine would be more important at that moment. Such surges were employed to get the SpaceX team to think more boldly but an act of impulsiveness that he later walked back.

It served a purpose of forcing new ideas, including getting rid of various shrouds and skirts, that would be incorporated into his goals for an improved Raptor. The exercise helped define what an ideal engine looks like but it was not moving the needle on stuff that was immediately needed to advance the Starship program.

<u>Learn by failing</u>

Take an iterative approach to design. Rockets and engines would be quickly prototyped, tested, blown up, revised, and tried again until finally something worked. Move fast, blow things up, revise and repeat. Try new ideas and be willing to blow things up.

*Starship, SpaceX*

Elon Musk admitted there was a reasonable chance that Starship would not work, but it was better to try and fail rather than analyse the issue for months.

“If you make this thing fast, you can find out fast. And then you can fix it fast.” He eventually succeeded in converting most of the parts into stainless steel.

<u>Polytopia life lessons</u>

During a period of time, Elon Musk was obsessed with Polytopia. Together with Kimbal Musk and Shivon Zilis, they developed the Polytopia life lessons.

1. **Empathy is not an asset.**

Polytopia teaches you how to think when you remove empathy since there is no empathy when you are playing a video game.

2. **Play life like a game.**

When you were playing strategy games as a kid and your mom unplugged it, you just did not notice and kept playing life as if it were that game.

3. **Do not fear losing.**

You will lose. It will hurt the first fifty times. When you get used to losing, you will play each game with less emotion. You will be more fearless, take more risks.

4. **Be proactive.**

Do not be a pacifist. Do not be reactive. Think through your best strategy. You can never win unless you take charge of setting the strategy.

5, **Optimise every turn.**

In Polytopia, you get only thirty turns, so you need to optimise each one. Like Polytopia, you only get a set number of turns in life.

6. **Double down.**

Push the edge of what is possible. You always want to be doubling down and putting everything back in the game to grow.

7. **Pick your battles.**

In Polytopia, you might find yourself surrounded by six or more tribes, all taking swipes at you. If you swipe back at all of them, you are going to lose.

8. **Unplug at times.**

Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, and Shivon Zilis deleted Polytopia from their phones.

“I had to take Polytopia off my phone because it was taking up too many brain cycles,” Elon Musk says. “I started dreaming about Polytopia.”

But the lesson about unplugging was another one that he never mastered. After a few months, he put the game back onto his phone and was playing again.

<u>Thinking about the future</u>

When Elon Musk gets stressed, he often retreats into the future. He will surprise his engineers, who are focused on some impending major event, by peppering them with questions about the details of things that are years away: plans for Mars landings, “Robotaxis” without steering wheels, implanted brain chips that can connect to computers.

When there was a problem, he would turn his attention to designing a future version of the product. That was what he did with Raptor. He declared that they were going to shift their attention to making a whole new engine.

<u>Money cannot buy happiness</u>

If it is true that money cannot buy happiness, one confirming data point was Elon Musk's mood when he became the person with the most of it. He was not happy in the fall of 2021.

“From 2007 onwards, until maybe last year, it has been nonstop pain. There is a gun to your head, make Tesla work, pull a rabbit out of your hat, then pull another rabbit out of the hat. A stream of rabbits flying through the air. If the next rabbit does not come out, you are dead. It takes a toll. You cannot be in a constant fight for survival, always in adrenaline mode, and not have it hurt you.

But there is something else I have found this year. It is that fighting to survive keeps you going for quite a while. When you are no longer in a survive-or-die mode, it is not that easy to get motivated every day.”

When things were most dire, he got energised. It was the siege mentality from his South African childhood. When he was not in survival-or-die mode, he felt unsettled. What should have been the good times were unnerving for him. It prompted him to launch surges, stir up dramas, throw himself into battles he could have bypassed, and bite off new endeavours.

<u>Launching new products</u>

When launching a new product, create a buzz that transforms it into an object of desire.

### Thoughts

<u>Emotional suppression</u>

I had believed that successful entrepreneurship requires suppressing emotions completely to handle risks better. While fear suppression might aid risk-taking, it can also diminish positive emotions like joy and empathy that make life fulfilling.

Using Elon Musk as an example, his emotional suppression from childhood trauma enables bold innovation but leads to harsh treatment of engineers. Despite his belief in impersonal “hardcore feedback,” some situations require empathy – like when an engineer underperformed after losing a child.

While improvement requires honest feedback and technical excellence matters (physics does not care about hurt feelings, it cares about whether you got the rocket right), the human element cannot be fully separated from performance and criticism. There are times when circumstances demand a more personal and empathetic approach to feedback, rather than purely impersonal critique.

Emotional detachment may help in taking business risks but complete emotional suppression is not ideal and empathy remains crucial for human interaction and leadership.

“It is not how well you avoid problems. It is how fast you figure out what the problem is and fix it.” - Elon Musk

<u>Siege mentality</u>

Elon Musk thrived on deadlines and wild surges of work. When he faces tortuous challenges, the strain would often keep him awake at night and make him vomit. But it also energised him.

Is this lifestyle worth it? For many, it is not. But for the few whose work is far too important (sustainable energy, space exploration and artificial general intelligence), this lifestyle is necessary.

Successful entrepreneurs are mean and drama-addicted. They act like assholes with no regard for the feelings of other people. On the behaviour of Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak asked this big question: Did he have to be so mean? So rough and cruel? So drama-addicted? If Steve Wozniak had run Apple, he would have been kinder but there might not be the Macintosh.

Extended periods of calm are unnerving for Elon Musk. Usually at such moments of unnerving success, he manufactures a drama. He launches a surge, scrambles the jets, announces an unrealistic and unnecessary deadline. He yanks the alarm chain and forces a fire drill. It accelerates us towards the future. Yet, in the case of Twitter, he decided to buy it without fully thinking about it, only to realise it was a dumpster fire that needed major fixing.

<u>Production hell</u>

During production of Tesla Model 3 in 2018, the sole focus of Tesla was to churn out thousands of vehicles. Elon Musk put a stake down by ordering all the materials to build the targeted amount of cars and monitored the factory 24/7. It was a hit the target or face bankruptcy moment. Such intensity to pump out impossible numbers push many to the edge of sanity. These are our modern day war stories.

“It is not the product that leads to success. It is the ability to make the product efficiently. It is about building the machine that guilds the machine. In other words, how do you design the factory?” - Elon Musk

<u>Work ethic</u>

The demanding work culture at Elon Musk's companies creates a self-selecting workforce of young employees without family commitments who prioritise mission over work-life balance. At Tesla and SpaceX, the missions are so important to humanity that workers are willing to be burnt out rather than get bored working for another company.

While this enables ambitious projects like Starship, it excludes experienced workers who could provide valuable expertise but require more balanced schedules. This presents a tradeoff between maintaining intense productivity and accessing diverse talent pools with industry experience.

<u>Demon mode</u>

Demon mode is when Elon Musk goes dark and retreats inside the storm in his brain. During the 2018 emotional turmoil at Tesla, Grimes tried to coax him to relax. “Everything doesn’t need to suck,” she told him. “You don’t need to feel stoked about everything all the time.”

However, his restlessness was a driver of his success. Demon mode causes a lot of chaos but it gets things done.

<u>Science fiction</u>

Elon Musk's sci-fi-inspired approach to AI safety through Optimus (humanoid robot following Isaac Asimov’s laws) and Neuralink (brain-computer interface inspired by Iain Banks’ “neural lace”). Both aim to ensure AI alignment by keeping AI systems closely tied to human control. Successful space entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos were influenced by science fiction, suggesting the genre's role in shaping transformative technological visions.

“While other entrepreneurs struggled to develop a worldview, Elon Musk developed a cosmic view.”

<u>Relationships</u>

From Justine Musk to Amber Heard, Elon Musk’s relationships were tumultuous and disastrous.

When he wanted to cancel his wedding with Justine Musk, his mother was relieved. “Now, you can be happy,” she told him.

Kimbal Musk described Amber Heard as “so toxic” and “a nightmare.” Elon Musk’s chief of staff compares her to a comic book villain. “She was like the Joker in Batman. She didn’t have a goal or aim other than chaos. She thrives on destabilising everything.”

Both Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates are divorced too.

<u>Twitter</u>

Between Twitterland and the Muskverse was a radical divergence in outlook that reflected two different mindsets about the workplace. Twitter prided itself on being a friendly place where coddling was considered a virtue. The company had instituted a permanent work-from-home option and allowed a mental “day of rest” each month. One of the commonly used buzzwords at the company was “psychological safety.” Care was taken not to discomfort.

In contrast, “psychological safety” made Elon Musk recoil. He considered it to be the enemy of urgency and progress. Discomfort is a weapon against the scourge of complacency.

He wanted to layoff 90 percent of the engineers. That made most at the table flinch. His lawyer urged caution. “I don’t understand why every single person that works at a social media company has to have 160 IQ and work twenty hours a day,” he argued. “Some people need to be good at selling, others need the emotional skills of good managers, and some are merely uploading user videos and don’t have to be superstars. Plus, cutting to the bone risked having the system fail if anyone got sick or fed up.”

Elon Musk wanted deep cuts for financial reasons and for a hardcore, fanatic work culture. He was willing to take risks and fly without a net. He brought one of the greatest shifts in corporate culture ever. Twitter had gone from being among the most nurturing workplaces, replete with free artisanal meals and yoga studios and paid rest days and concern for “psychological safety,” to the other extreme.

“What Twitter needs is a fire-breathing dragon.” - Elon Musk

<u>Conclusion</u>

In the end, even the best people are moulded out of faults.

> Do the audaciousness and hubris that drive him to attempt epic feats excuse his bad behaviour, his callousness, his recklessness? The times he’s an asshole? The answer is no, of course not. One can admire a person’s good traits and decry the bad ones. But it’s also important to understand how the strands are woven together, sometimes tightly. It can be hard to remove the dark ones without unravelling the whole cloth. As Shakespeare teaches us, all heroes have flaws, some tragic, some conquered, and those we cast as villains can be complex.

> But would a restrained Elon Musk accomplish as much as an Elon Musk unbound? Is being unfiltered and untethered integral to who he is? Could you get the rockets to orbit or the transition to electric vehicles without accepting all aspects of him, hinged and unhinged? Sometimes great innovators are risk-seeking man-children who resist potty training. They can be reckless, cringeworthy, sometimes even toxic. They can also be crazy. Crazy enough to think they can change the world.

I love biographies. There are aspects of a person’s life that you may want to emulate and other parts that you definitely do not want to. Read. Learn. Then, apply any applicable lessons to your life.

> Elon Musk’s life had long been an admixture of historically transforming achievements along with wild flameouts, broken promises, and arrogant impulses. Both his accomplishments and failures were epic.
