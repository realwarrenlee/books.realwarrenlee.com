### Summary

The Nvidia Way explores Nvidia's journey to becoming the most valuable company, focusing on its culture of innovation, strategic decision-making, and the leadership principles of its CEO, Jensen Huang. It highlights how Nvidia disrupted markets, including GPUs, accelerated computing, parallel computing and artificial intelligence, through bold vision and calculated risk-taking.

### Lessons

<u>Pain and suffering</u>

When his parents sold everything to send him and his brother to what they thought was a prep school – but was actually a reform school – Jensen faced physical violence. Rather than breaking him, the experience built his resilience, teaching him to be unafraid of new challenges and tolerate discomfort.

While working at Denny’s, Jensen acquired significant life skills, including navigating chaos, working under pressure, communicating effectively with customers, and handling errors. Beyond practical life skills, Jensen discovered the importance of taking pride in every task, no matter how menial. He attributes his rise from scrubbing toilets to managing entire divisions of a microchip company not to intelligence alone but to his willingness and ability to put in more effort and tolerate more suffering than others.

Nvidia’s first product, the NV1, failed due to overengineering with features no one wanted and Jensen's inexperience. Nvidia faced mass layoffs and financial crises. But through every setback, the company adapted, retained its most dedicated employees, and emerged stronger. Yet, amid the stress and pressure, the company learned from each misstep. It retained a core group of dedicated employees who remain with the company decades later. Jensen credits his ability to endure pain as a key reason he has led Nvidia for over 30 years.

Jensen believes that people with high expectations often have low resilience and resilience is what matters in success. To him, true greatness stems not from intelligence but from character. And character is built, earned, and forged through overcoming setbacks, facing adversity, and refusing to give up.

> Tortured into greatness.

<u>Opportunity</u>

Nvidia was founded by Jensen, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. By the early 1990s, Sun Microsystems had lost the fast-moving, startup-like culture that once fueled innovation. Bureaucracy had taken over, slowing decision-making and turning competition into a battle of PowerPoint presentations rather than breakthrough ideas. When Malachowsky and Priem decided to leave Sun Microsystems, they faced a crucial challenge – while they possessed the technical expertise, they lacked business and contractual knowledge. They turned to the best person they knew – Jensen. They admired his brilliance and loved working with him. Initially, they asked him to draft a contract for an idea they planned to pitch to Samsung. But Jensen saw a bigger opportunity. Instead of handing their idea over to another company, he convinced them to build it themselves. This pivotal moment – when Jensen transformed what could have been a simple contract-writing favor into the foundation of a new company – epitomises how recognising and seizing opportunities can lead to even greater ones. That decision led to the founding of Nvidia.

When customers began “hacking” Nvidia’s GPUs for scientific research beyond graphics processing, Jensen recognised a pivotal opportunity. Rather than dismissing this unintended use, he saw the potential for expanding Nvidia's market in a fundamentally new direction.

First, Nvidia made its technology more accessible through CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a new programming model that simplified GPU computing for non-graphics applications. Jensen's strategic insight was profound: by making the technology easier to use, they could expand their market exponentially. The hiring of Mark Harris, who coined the term “GPGPU” (General-Purpose computing on GPUs), demonstrated Jensen's commitment to bringing in key talent to execute this vision.

Second, Nvidia invested heavily in market education and development. They created educational resources, developed university partnerships, and established comprehensive training programs. This investment in education was crucial for establishing CUDA as an industry standard. Jensen understood that technological superiority alone was not enough – they needed to teach people how to use it.

Third, Nvidia demonstrated extraordinary commitment to this vision, even at the cost of short-term profitability. When adapting GPUs for CUDA compatibility reduced gross margins from 45% to 35%, Jensen maintained course. Later, when he recognized AI's potential, he made it the company's highest priority, redirecting the entire organization's resources toward this opportunity.

Seeing the potential  that GPUs could power far more than graphics, Jensen made AI Nvidia’s top priority, directing the entire company’s resources toward this opportunity. This all-in approach positioned Nvidia at the forefront of the AI revolution, proving that handling one opportunity well creates even greater ones.

<u>Teacher</u>

In another life, Jensen might have been a teacher. Many of history's greatest founders have viewed themselves as teachers first, using this mindset to shape their leadership style. By teaching their employees, leaders create “alter egos” within their team – individuals who can execute their roles as effectively as the leader. This approach ensures that the company’s philosophy and values are deeply embedded in its culture. Ultimately, great founders evolve into evangelists, tirelessly championing the company’s mission and values.

<u>Nvidia is Jensen</u>

Jensen’s personality, values, and work ethic are deeply woven into Nvidia’s DNA, making the company a reflection of himself. He has shaped Nvidia in his own image, making it an extension of himself. Jensen manages Nvidia with a hands-on approach, directly overseeing product decisions, sales negotiations, and investor relations. He does not isolate himself in a private office, instead staying closely connected to the pulse of the organisation.

Nvidia is a race car, with Jensen as its driver. Great founders like him are unstoppable, irrepressible forces of nature.

> Everyone at the company shared Jensen's singular focus on the mission, everyone shared his work ethic, everyone worked as fast as humanly possible in order to keep Nvidia one step ahead of the competition.

> Jensen is surely the only person who could have gotten Nvidia to where it is today. He grasps technology and business strategy and also understands the harder work of actually operating a large business, day to day. He personally enforces his own high standards and snuffs out the dysfunction before it can take root. He has structured Nvidia to generate step-change performance, not the slow crawl of incremental improvement. The entire business operates at the speed of light, and if Jensen catches you coasting, he will call you out in front of everyone. Perhaps the most succinct definition of the Nvidia Way is that it is Jensen’s way, or that it is simply Jensen himself.

<u>Reputation</u>

During his time at LSI Logic, Jensen earned the trust of CEO Wilfred Corrigan through relentless effort and a commitment to excellence in every task. When Jensen decided to start Nvidia, Corrigan facilitated an introduction to Don Valentine, the founder of Sequoia Capital. The connection held weight – Sequoia Capital had profited significantly from its investments in LSI Logic, and Valentine trusted Corrigan’s judgment.

Despite Jensen’s disastrous pitch, Valentine decided to invest. Valentine told Jensen bluntly, “Against my best judgment, based on what you just told me, I am going to give you money. But if you lose my money, I will kill you.”  Valentine invested in Nvidia not because of the business plan or the demo, but on the strength of Jensen’s reputation.

> Your reputation will precede you even if your business plan writing skills are inadequate.

<u>Whiteboard</u>

Rather than Apple’s Demo and Amazon’s 6-page memo, Nvidia relies on the whiteboard for their primary form of communication in meetings. The whiteboard symbolises both potential and impermanence – even the best ideas evolve. It forces individuals to forget the past and focus on what is important at the present moment.

The whiteboard fosters transparency and rigour. Writing on a whiteboard demands active, real-time thinking and exposes an individual's grasp of the topic. Unlike polished presentations, there is nowhere to hide. Ultimately, the whiteboard’s value depends entirely on the person holding the marker – it can reflect genius, but it cannot create it.

> It represents both possibility and ephemerality – the belief that a successful idea, no matter how brilliant, must eventually be erased, and a new one must take its place.

> At the whiteboard, Jensen will sketch out how to organize a particular market, how to accelerate growth of a particular product, and the software or hardware technical stacks involved in a particular case. His whiteboarding creates a specific kind of meeting, one dedicated to solving problems, not reviewing things that have already been done.

<u>Flat organisational structure</u>

Jensen adopted a flat structure to promote faster decision-making and encourage greater individual responsibility. He manages 60 direct reports but does not conduct one-on-one meetings with them, believing that a flat structure eliminates bureaucratic bottlenecks that can frustrate talented employees and drive them away. This approach creates an environment that attracts individuals who thrive on independence while filtering out those who prefer rigid guidance.

Jensen provides his direct reports with company-wide information and strategic guidance but avoids offering career coaching, as most of them are already at the peak of their careers. Instead, his focus is on fostering transparency and shared understanding across the company. 

By openly reasoning through problems and explaining his decisions, Jensen offers junior employees a unique opportunity to learn how a senior leader approaches complex challenges. “Let me reason through this. Let me explain why I did that,” he said. “How do we compare and contrast these ideas? That process of management is really empowering.”

> It turns out that by having a lot of direct reports, not having one-on-ones, we made the company flat, information travels quickly, employees are empowered.

<u>Public criticism</u>

Jensen's approach to criticism is deliberately public, rooted in his belief that organisational learning comes from shared experiences. His intent is not to embarrass or hurt, but to emphasise that the quality of work is paramount. He gives feedback openly in large meetings, allowing the entire company to learn from individual errors. "I do it right there. I give you feedback in front of everybody," he explained.

His trademark directness and impatience manifest in all settings, sometimes resulting in 15 minutes of critiques regardless of venue. These public corrections serve a deeper purpose beyond immediate feedback – they reflect Jensen's relentless fight against complacency and commitment to excellence.

> Feedback is learning. For what reason are you the only person who should learn this? You created the conditions because of some mistake you made or silliness that you brought upon yourself. We should all learn from that opportunity.

<u>Self-criticism</u>

Despite his charisma and self-confidence, Jensen is driven by an insatiable inner voice that says nothing he ever does is good enough. This relentless self-criticism serves as both his greatest motivator and his harshest critic, stemming from his belief that complacency kills. It fuels his continuous pursuit of improvement.

Reflecting on Nvidia’s early years, Jensen acknowledges he was not a great CEO during the first 15 years. He admits that the team's early performance was poor, and it was through persistent adjustment and reflection that he refined his leadership approach.

Even at the pinnacle of success, Jensen remains committed to self-improvement. “I wake up every morning, I look at myself in the mirror and I say you suck,” he said, underscoring his dedication to pushing himself to achieve more.

> When we were younger, we sucked at a lot of things. Nvidia wasn’t a great company on day one. We made it great over thirty-one years.

> We survived ourselves. We were our own worst enemy.

<u>Speed of Light</u>

Since Nvidia’s founding, Jensen has insisted that the company operate at the “Speed of Light.” To him, work should be constrained only by the laws of physics – not by internal politics or financial constraints. Every project is broken down into its component tasks, each with a target time-to-completion based on the fastest theoretical pace, assuming no delays or downtime. This “Speed of Light” represents the absolute maximum speed achievable, a benchmark the company strives to reach.

Jensen believes Nvidia should measure its performance not against past achievements or competitors but solely against this theoretical maximum. He had witnessed the “internal rot” in other companies where employees often manipulated their projects to provide steady and sustainable growth that would advance their individual careers, when in reality they were making only incremental improvements that actually hurt the company in the long term, and he was determined to prevent Nvidia from falling into the same trap of complacency. By measuring against the speed of light itself, he created an impossible standard that drives continuous innovation.

The development of the Riva 128 graphics chip exemplifies this philosophy in action. In a bold departure from industry norms, Jensen ordered the development of driver software before the prototype chip was complete. This unconventional approach required skipping the usual testing phase on physical chips, a risky decision made possible by investing heavily in an emulator. Despite Nvidia’s tight financial situation at the time, Jensen prioritised this investment to keep the company working at the speed of light, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to innovation and efficiency.

> How fast can you do it, and why aren’t you doing it that fast?

> We’re not going to judge ourselves on what we used to do, we’re not going to judge ourselves on what other companies do. We are going to judge ourselves against the speed of life.

<u>LUA</u>

Listen to the question. Understand the question. Answer the question.

When Jensen uses the term “Lua,” it is a directive for the speaker to stop what they are doing and refocus on these three steps. This ensures that conversations remain focused and efficient. By using “Lua” as an interrupt signal, Jensen reinforces his expectation for precise thinking and clear articulation in every interaction within the company.

<u>Extreme</u>

Jensen believes that no one will outwork him and that long hours are a necessary prerequisite for excellence. To him, a company’s success is directly tied to the effort invested, and there is no such thing as overwork when the goal is to be the best. His leadership style is defined by relentless intensity and an extreme focus.

This intensity manifests in unexpected ways, as illustrated by a telling encounter with Kenneth Hurley, a technical marketing engineer. “I’m not the kind of guy who likes to talk in the bathroom,” Hurley later recalled. But Jensen had no such reservations. “Hey, what’s up?” he asked. Hurley’s casual “not much” was met with a sidelong glance from Jensen. Panicked, Hurley frantically detailed 20 ongoing projects, from developer relations to technical training initiatives. Only then did Jensen seem satisfied, having extracted a work update.

Jensen's extreme leadership style transformed into strategic advantage when he made a bold decision to restructure Nvidia's design team. By splitting it into 3 groups, each tasked with releasing a new chip every 6 months – while competitors took 18 months – he created an unprecedented development cycle. This strategy ensured that Nvidia always had 3 times as many chips on the market, none more than 6 months old. Even if a competitor briefly released a superior product, PC manufacturers had little incentive to switch, knowing a faster NVIDIA chip was always just months away.

Jensen’s intensity extends beyond individual interactions – it shapes the culture of Nvidia. When recruiting a chief engineer from Silicon Graphics, he openly declared his intention to “put SGI out of business.” This reflected his commitment to pushing Nvidia to move 3 times faster than any competitor, fostering a culture of extreme discipline and execution.

As one engineer discovered, there was no hidden “secret sauce” to Nvidia’s success. “It turns out it’s just really hard work and intense execution on schedules,” he noted. Ultimately, Nvidia’s culture of extreme work habits and uncompromising standards became its true competitive edge.

> People who train for the Olympics grumble about training early in the morning, too.

> You have to allow yourself to be obsessed with your work. I work every day. There's not a day that goes by that I don't work. If I'm not working, I'm thinking about working. Working is relaxing for me.

> Your competition doesn’t go to sleep.

> Second place is the first loser.

<u>Top 5 emails</u>

The "Top 5 email" system is a cornerstone of Nvidia’s internal communication, requiring every employee, regardless of rank, to send a weekly email outlining their current priorities and observations. For Jensen, this system serves as a crucial feedback channel that bypasses layers of management to capture insights directly “from the edge.” By reading these emails, Jensen aims to detect weak signals – subtle but significant shifts in the market or operations that junior employees might notice before they reach executive staff.

Reading roughly a hundred of these emails daily gives Jensen a snapshot of company operations and emerging trends. He is unapologetically blunt about the importance of these insights. He told his executive staff, “Don’t take this the wrong way, but you may not have the brainpower or the wherewithal to detect something I think is pretty significant.”

This system proved particularly valuable in detecting early market signals. When multiple employees began mentioning machine learning trends in their Top 5 emails, Jensen recognised they were not moving fast enough to seize the opportunity. Acting swiftly, he instructed his team to allocate more software engineers to developing the RAPIDS CUDA library, which later became a key tool for accelerating machine learning and data science workloads on GPUs.

Driven by Jensen, Nvidia’s email culture is rigorous. He often replies to emails within minutes, expecting employees to respond thoughtfully and with hard data within 24 hours. Those who fail to meet his standards receive his typical sarcastic response, “Oh, is that right?” This approach strengthened internal communication and cemented the company’s ability to adapt quickly and stay ahead in the competitive tech landscape.

> The ideal top five e-mail is five bullet points where the first word is an action word. It has to be something like finalise, build, or secure.

> It's easy to pick up on the strong signals but I want to intercept them when they are weak.

<u>Strategy</u>

True strategy is defined by actions and decisions, not by elaborate plans or theoretical discussions. Jensen prioritises daily execution over long-term planning documents, recognising that the world is dynamic and ever-changing. He views rigid, long-term plans as limiting rather than effective, as excessive planning constraints freedom of action. Instead, he advocates for continuous planning – constantly adjusting to new information and maintaining the agility to pivot whenever necessary.

> Strategy is not what I say, it is what we do.

<u>Mission</u>

Jensen believes that Nvidia’s mission should be the ultimate guiding force, not its internal structures or individual interests. He observed that as organisations grow, they often become self-perpetuating bureaucracies, losing sight of their original purpose. To prevent this, Jensen ensures that every project at Nvidia aligns directly with its mission, allowing the company to remain agile and shift resources as needed.

Under the “mission is the boss” philosophy, Jensen initiates every new project by appointing a “Pilot in Command” (PIC) – a leader who reports directly to him. This system fosters stronger accountability and greater motivation than standard divisional structure. In exchange for this high level of accountability, PICs are granted Jensen’s full authority and receive priority support throughout the organisation.

Nvidia’s workforce is structured functionally – grouped into teams like sales, engineering, and operations – rather than business divisions. This flexible model enables talent to be deployed dynamically based on project needs, reducing inefficiencies and offering employees greater stability in an industry often plagued by job insecurity.

<u>Talent</u>

Jensen believes that exceptional talent is invaluable – it is nearly impossible to overpay for top talent. This conviction extends beyond offering competitive salaries. It is about creating a system where extraordinary contributions are recognised and rewarded. This philosophy is based on the premise that top performers not only exhibit high productivity but also attract other high-caliber individuals, reinforcing a cycle of talent acquisition and retention.

Regarding hiring, Jensen is willing to pay above market rates to secure the best talent. He believes that exceptional individuals bring disproportionate value to the company.

Regarding retention, Jensen uses stock allocation reports to identify outstanding contributors. Managers can nominate employees for “special consideration,” placing them on a Top Contributor (TC) list. Jensen awards selected employees special, one-time stock grants that vest over four years, reinforcing a culture of appreciation and long-term commitment. 

Jensen avoids waiting for annual reviews to reward exceptional performance. Instead, he directly intervenes to grant stock, ensuring immediate recognition of individual achievements. This cultivates a culture where excellence is continuously encouraged and appreciated. When a stock grant is approved, the employee receives an email from a senior executive, with Jensen copied, bearing the subject line “Special Grant.” The email clearly explains the reason for the award, ensuring that recipients understand the specific contributions that led to their recognition.

<u>Complacency</u>

Jensen views complacency as a greater threat to Nvidia’s success than external competition. He believes even a small degree of complacency can lead to stagnation, decline, and ultimately, failure.

A truly sustainable business must focus as much on maintaining its internal culture as on external growth. When Nvidia became the dominant force in graphics, its leadership became distracted by external factors (partners, investors, and financials) and overlooked a growing internal problem. Complacency nearly destroyed the company.

Jensen recognised that disruption can emerge from the lower end of the market, not just from established competitors. To avoid the innovator’s dilemma, Nvidia employs a strategy known as “shipping the whole cow” – repurposing components that do not meet high-end standards to create lower-cost versions. This approach enables Nvidia to remain competitive across all market segments.

Nvidia adopted the mantra “We’re thirty days from going out of business” to instill a sense of urgency into its culture. This was not just a warning about complacency, but an expectation that every employee, starting with Jensen himself, would work relentlessly, often at great personal sacrifice, to keep the company ahead.

<u>Create markets</u>

Jensen does not focus on competing for existing market share – he aims to create entirely new markets where Nvidia can lead. This strategy ensures Nvidia avoids becoming a commodity business, where competition drives prices down and erodes profitability. Instead, Nvidia pursues technological breakthroughs that establish entirely new market categories where they can maintain leadership and pricing power.

First, Nvidia focuses on creating products that others cannot replicate, pushing the boundaries of engineering and innovation. Second, Nvidia develops technologies that expand market opportunities by making complex capabilities more accessible. 

The development of CUDA exemplifies how Nvidia transforms existing technologies into new market opportunities. Rather than simply improving graphics cards, CUDA made GPU computing accessible to a broader audience, expanding GPU applications far beyond gaming. This innovation created new opportunities in fields like scientific research and high-performance computing for Nvidia.

Nvidia's dominance in the AI market is the ultimate illustration of market creation. By heavily investing in GPU acceleration for machine learning, Nvidia not only capitalised on AI but effectively shaped the entire AI computing landscape.

> We don’t steal market share, we create markets.

### Thoughts

This is the first in-depth book on Nvidia, chronicling its history and its rise to becoming the world’s most valuable company. Naturally, I was eager to read it. Like many stories of visionary founders, Nvidia's story reveals a profound truth – the company’s meteoric rise was not primarily driven by innate genius or revolutionary intelligence. Instead, its success emerged from relentless hard work, resilience, and sheer will. The journey did not have to be this difficult, but it was – and always would be.

What struck me most was how precariously close Nvidia came to collapse and outright destruction. Had just a few events unfolded differently, the trajectory of computing itself might have changed, shaping an entirely different world. Consider the pivotal choices that shaped Nvidia's destiny. Malachowsky might have pursued medicine after taking the MCAT, or accepted a position at Digital Equipment instead of joining Sun Microsystems – a decision that originally began as merely a practice interview. Similarly, Curtis Priem could have chosen to make the NV1 chip conform to market standards, potentially achieving immediate success. However, that initial failure proved invaluable, leading to the development of the RIVA 128 – a chip that ultimately saved the company. As Priem himself reflected, “Nvidia would have been a failure if NV1 had not failed.”

The story of Nvidia’s survival and eventual dominance is inseparable from moments of extraordinary luck. One of the most pivotal examples came during a critical period during the development of the NV2. Sega's president generously provided Nvidia with funding even when the project was not completed. It was a crucial act of kindness that allowed Nvidia to survive a precarious early phase.

But perhaps even more fascinating is how Nvidia stumbled into what would become its most transformative opportunity – the AI revolution. Nvidia’s entry into machine learning was not driven by market analysis or strategic planning. Instead, it began with a seemingly unrelated academic pursuit of a PhD thesis on clouds. At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a computer science researcher named Mark Harris sought to use computers to better simulate complex natural phenomena, such as fluid dynamics and atmospheric thermodynamics. His work laid the foundation for general-purpose GPU computing, which led to CUDA, enabled machine learning breakthroughs on Nvidia’s hardware, and ultimately positioned the company at the center of the AI revolution.

The story of Nvidia reveals the extraordinary value of patience. This virtue manifested both in Jensen’s personal life and his leadership of Nvidia, creating a foundation for decisions that would ultimately prove transformative. Jensen demonstrated remarkable patience in his pursuit of education. While balancing the responsibilities of a young family with two children, he took 8 years to complete his master's degree. 

This capacity for patience proved crucial when Nvidia recognised the potential of GPUs in machine learning. Jensen needed to convince his company, investors, and himself to embrace a longer timeline than Silicon Valley typically tolerates. In an industry notorious for its relentless demand for quick returns and rapid innovation, Jensen decided to play the long game. The development of CUDA became a testament to this patient approach. Despite mounting pressure from investors who sought faster returns and pushed for strategic pivots, Jensen remained steadfast in his conviction. “I believed in CUDA,” he said. “We were convinced that accelerated computing would solve problems that normal computers couldn’t. We had to make that sacrifice. I had a deep belief in its potential.”

The conventional wisdom in business often emphasises the importance of detailed long-term planning, yet Nvidia’s story challenges this assumption. Jensen’s leadership reveals a different kind of strategic thinking – one that prioritises preparation and adaptability over rigid planning horizons.

Though he did not quite realise it, Jensen had dedicated Nvidia’s first two decades to laying the groundwork for the company’s eventual dominance in AI. He did not possess some extraordinary visionary power that allowed him to predict exactly when AI would take off. In fact, Nvidia initially took a measured approach, allocating only limited resources to AI development until clear signals emerged about its potential. But when that moment arrived, Jensen moved with unmatched speed and conviction, outpacing the competition.

The acquisition of Mellanox provides a perfect case study of this strategic approach in action. Initially, the Mellanox opportunity was not immediately apparent to Jensen. However, once Nvidia recognised its significance, the company pursued the deal aggressively. Securing Mellanox was only the beginning – the true challenge lay in execution. In this regard, Mellanox epitomises a typical Nvidia achievement – the company pounced when others did not, and Mellanox helped power Nvidia’s rise to dominance in the AI space.
